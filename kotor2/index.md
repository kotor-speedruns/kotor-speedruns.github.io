## Glitch Guides

These guides cover specific glitches used frequently in KotOR speedrunning, including detailed instructions and videos for performing the glitch.  If you're looking to polish up on a specific type of glitch, these are the guides for you.

Glitch guides are split into three types:
- **Dev Tools:** These glitches are actually features left in by the developers to play test parts of the game; they do not exist at all in the legacy versions of the game. They are characterized by extreme game-breaking skips and abilities, and only allowed in the Unrestricted ruleset. 
- **Major Glitches:** These glitches are not to the same level as Dev Tools, but still have game breaking effects that bypass normal gameplay.  These glitches are legal in the Unrestricted and No Dev Tools rulesets.
- **Techniques:** These glitches have more minor effects, such as skipping cutscenes or other minor timesaves.  These glitches are legal in the Unrestricted and No Dev Tools rulesets.

| | Dev Tools | | | | Techniques | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [Dev Droid](./Dev%20Tools/3C-FD) | [Dev Character](./Dev%20Tools/Dev%20Character) | | | [Combat Talking](</kotor2/Techniques/Combat Talking>) | [Conversation Queue](</kotor2/Techniques/Conversation Queue>) | [Damage Stacking](</kotor2/Techniques/Damage Stacking>) |
| | **Major Glitches** | | | | [Revive Your Party Warp](./Techniques/RYP%20Warp) | [Save Buffering](./Techniques/Save%20Buffering) | [Save Teleporting](./Techniques/Save%20Teleporting) |
