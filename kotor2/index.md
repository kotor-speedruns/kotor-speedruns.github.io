## Glitch Guides

These guides cover specific glitches used frequently in KotOR speedrunning, including detailed instructions and videos for performing the glitch.  If you're looking to polish up on a specific type of glitch, these are the guides for you.

Glitch guides are split into three types:
- **Dev Tools:** These glitches are more are actually features left in by the developers to play test parts of the game; they do not exist at all in the legacy versions of the game. They are characterized by extreme game-breaking skips and abilities, and only allowed in the Unrestricted ruleset. 
- **Other Glitches:** All other glitches are grouped together in KotOR II, regardless of their power or difficulty.  Some can significantly sequence-break the game, or completely bypass the usual rules of normal gameplay, while others have more minor effects.  These glitches are legal in the Unrestricted and No Dev Tools rulesets.
