# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords - Max Quests Glitchless Guide

## v2.0.1: Female Jedi Guardian Route (Light Side)

*First of all, major credit to goes out to [30cents](https://www.speedrun.com/user/30Cents) for his help with some route improvements and [Sanjan](https://www.speedrun.com/user/Sanjan) for their work on the Any% Glitchless route. I would also like to thank [AtomicHeartSon](https://www.speedrun.com/user/AtomicHeartSon), for jumping in and beginning the routing progress for this category, it wouldn't be where it is today without his initial eagerness to bring this to life.*

This route defeats Darth Traya on Malachor V while also completing the Max amount of the Quests in a single run as fast as possible without the use of glitches. Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends on the last hit on Traya as the screen fades to black. A load-removal tool is available for LiveSplit thanks to glasnonck; times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent. This guide will cover the character build for the run, as well as a detailed route.

If you have additional questions, you can check out the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](https://www.speedrun.com/kotor2/thread/lgj5g). There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer your questions!

## Glitchless Ruleset

All glitches are banned, with the exception of the following:
- Fast text (unavoidable without restarting the game frequently)
- Duration glitch (also unavoidable, and semirandom at this point in time, though it is less effective in this game than in KOTOR 1)

In addition, exploits that give infinite experience, credits, or alignment points are also banned.

Due to its glitchy nature, QUICKSAVE is banned as well. Manual and autosaves, however, are allowed.

No mods are allowed to be used (Yes, this also includes the restoration mod!)

## General Tips

- If running on any monitor over 60 Hertz (hz), underclock it to 60hz exactly. If not done, your game will hang after combat and restrict you from moving. This is due to this game being made to suit a maximum of 60hz and to not be played exceeding 60 FPS.
- Unbind your quicksave key! You can do this by setting the Quicksave key (default F4) to the Quickload Key (default F5) then setting the Quickload key back to F5.
- Learn how to swap abilities easily. Shift +# swaps the ability. (e.g shift+1 swaps from Critical Strike to Flurry etc. Shift+4 swaps force powers)
- Watch someone's PB video while going through the notes! This is very important to fundamentally understand the run and how it flows, and learn possible tricks to make your run much faster and smoother.
- Manual save a lot! The game tends to be very wonky, it can be prone to crashing in the worst moments, especially if you're on a good run! You'll figure out key points to save while you practice the run.
- Once you understand the fundamentals from these notes, make your own copy of the notes and modify them to your own use. These notes are made detailed for a new player, and once you become more experienced you will need less of these notes.
- Remember to have fun!

## Character Build

### Character Creation

We begin the game as a Jedi Guardian mainly to make use of the Force Jump ability, and its Strength for combat. A female character is chosen because instead of Handmaiden, which you attain as a male character, we get the Disciple. Having Handmaiden incurs extra cutscenes with Atris at the end of the game, thus resulting in a slower run.

Our main character only needs skill investment in Treat Injury (TI), as 'Affect Mind'/'Dominate Mind' are used for anything requiring persuasion.

**Initial Attributes**

- Strength - 18
- Dexterity - 14
- Constitution - 14
- Intelligence - 8
- Wisdom - 10
- Charisma - 8

**Initial Skills**

- Treat Injury - 4 (Pressing recommended will do this for you, as is the same for all level ups.)

**Initial Feat** - Weapon Focus: Melee

We will be focussing on melee attacks with a sword/lightsaber in this run, so we max out 'Strength' immediately, and get enough 'Dexterity' and 'Constitution' to help us survive. The final two points are put into 'Wisdom' for a slightly better chance at resisting Force Powers at the end of the game, as well as it gives us slightly more Force Points (FP).

Treat Injury (TI) will be our main skill, since there are no strict skill requirements we have to meet. Each level up we can select 'Recommended' in skills for ease and speed.

We choose 'Weapon Focus: Melee' for the attack boost before getting our lightsaber; we pick it over 'Two-Weapon Fighting' since this feat takes longer to select and character creation isn't timed. This will in turn result in our first level up being faster than if we chose 'Two-Weapon Fighting' now. 

### Leveling Plan
<br>

| Level | Feats | Powers |
| --- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Weapon Focus: Melee | --- |
| 2 | Two-Weapon Fighting | Burst of Speed |
| 3 | Weapon-Focus: Lightsaber | Affect Mind |
| 4 | --- | Force Valor |
| 5 | Improved Two-Weapon Fighting | Energy Resistance |
| 6 | --- | Force Deflection |
| 7 | Improved Critical Strike | Dominate Mind |
| 8 | --- | Battle Meditation |
| 9 | Master Two-Weapon Fighting | Knight Speed |
| 10 | --- | Knight Valor |
| 11 | Master Critical Strike | Improved Energy Resistance |
| 12 | --- | Force Redirection |
| 13 | Weapon Specialization: Lightsaber | Improved Battle Meditation |
| 14 | --- | Force Barrier |
| 15 | Toughness (Recommended) | Master Speed |

<br>
You will notice attributes and skills aren't listed here. This is because when we level up, all skills/attribute points will use the 'Recommended' option (Strength/Treat Injury respectively).

Our main combat plan is lots of Strength, 'Master Two-Weapon Fighting', 'Master Critical Strike', and 'Knight Speed' using dual lightsabers. This gives us attacks that will deal as much damage as possible; we want to hit as hard as possible, since enemies in the later parts of the game will have higher HP. Once we get the lightsaber form 'Shien' from Master Zez-Kai-Ell, we will switch to this form for the rest of the run.

Other notes:

**Skill notes:**
- We use TI to make our medpac use more efficient. And in turn it is the fastest way to select our skills
- Persuade isn't used in this run as Affect Mind and Dominate Mind are sufficent for all of our needs of persuasion.

**Feat notes:**
- 'Weapon Focus: Lightsaber' is chosen since there aren't other good feats at level 3, and it gives +1 to attack when we get our lightsaber later.
- 'Critical Strike' and 'Two-Weapon Fighting' are our main combat core.
- At level 14 we choose 'Weapon Specialization: Lightsaber' as this will add a +2 damage bonus to our hits and will help for the endgame.
- It is hit and miss whether we will reach Level 15 or not, but if so we recommend choosing 'Toughness' purely due to being able to click recommended. This gives us slightly higher VP but most importantly it is quick to select.

**Force Power notes:**
- 'Burst of Speed' is the most important power, giving us 100% increased movement speed. With no Save Teleports, this is an essential power for the run. Knight Speed also grants +1 attack per round, which is highly important due to our relatively low chance to hit. 'Burst of Speed' also gives us +2 Defense while active.
- If MC reaches level 15, Master Speed grants us +2 attacks per round while active.
- Duration Glitch in this game is not as effective as in KOTOR 1, so we will be using these Force Speed powers much more. We will generally take Kreia into our party as a second source of Force Points (FP) due to the Force Bond ability affecting MC and Kreia.
- 'Force Valor' is used to boost stats and saving throws for various combat sections in the game. Later this will be levelled up to 'Knight Valor'.
- 'Affect Mind'/'Dominate Mind' is used in the following places:
	i. 'Affect Mind' is required to persuade the receptionist in the Exchange Base to allow you through.
	ii. 'Dominate Mind' persuades Captain Bostuco to leave his post during Onderon 1.
	iii. It is required that we have 'Dominate Mind' in order to complete the 'Lupo's Advantage' quest on Nar Shaddaa.
- 'Energy Resistance' is not particularly useful, but there aren't any worthwhile Force Powers to get at level 5. This force power is mainly chosen as there isn't any other worthwhile force powers to choose from during this level up.
- 'Force Deflect' is taken as it's a nice defensive passive skill, and you frequently run through heavy amounts of ranged enemies during the run.
- 'Battle Meditation' is a nice filler, it lasts 20 seconds, and provides very good stat boosts for fights provided you have the spare force to use it. We can use 'Battle Meditation' to help Kreia fight the cleaning droid on Nar Shaddaa during the 'Experiment in Delivery: Bonus Mission'.
- 'Breath Control' is attained for free during the Jek Jek Tarr section on Nar Shaddaa. It makes us immune to poison, but we don't use it in this run at all. It could be helpful to use on Malachor V if you want to avoid getting poisoned running to Trayus Academy.
- 'Force Barrier' is taken at Level 14 as it is quick and easy. We don't end up using this power in the run at all.
- 'Force Redirection' is the upgrade to 'Force Deflect' and is taken for its added bonuses, but also as a filler for a faster level up.
- 'Improved Energy Resistance'/'Improved Battle Meditation': These are chosen as quick options during their respective level ups, due to having to choose a force power each time we level up. These powers are not used in the run.

**Level Up notes:** <br>
Level ups 2-8 will need to be used at the correct times as shown in the Detailed Route below. <br>
- Level Up to 2: Peragus, Administration Console. <br>
- Level Up to 3: Peragus, Final Run. <br> 
- Level Up to 4: Telos Citadel Station, before Ithorian Droid. <br>
- Level Up to 5: Telos Citadel Station, after Escaped Criminals. <br>
- Level Up to 6: Telos Citadel Station, quick heal during Mercenaries fight at Czerka. <br>
- Level Up to 7: Dantooine, quick heal during fighting Matriarch.  <br>
- Level Up to 8: Dxun, quick heal during fighting Zakkeg. <br>
- Level Up to 9: Dxun, before Sith Ambush. <br>

## Equipment Plan

One of the many special differences KOTOR 2 has compared to KOTOR 1 is that many of the drops/containers you loot are randomized. The base items listed below are all guaranteed items, but it is possible you may obtain items in your run that are more optimal to equip before getting the guaranteed items (or could possibly be better!).

**Implant**: Power Implant
- Bought on Nar Shaddaa from Geeda (1615 credits) <br>
Since we don’t have enough Constitution to equip a Nerve Enhancement System, and only Sion and Traya use stunning force powers against us, we go for offensive items and this implant is the easiest guaranteed item we can access that gives us +2 STR.

**Headgear**: Targeting Visor
- Obtained from dead mercenary in the Enclave Ruins <br>
The only guaranteed headgear we can obtain, this gives us a +1 to attack and +1 to reflex saves. If you find other better headgear, prioritize equipping those over this helmet.

**Gloves**: Sith Power Gauntlets
- Obtained from Sith Lord at Freedon Nadd’s Tomb <br>
This is used for the +3 Strength; which gives us a lot of damage and accuracy.

**Body**: Jal Shey Neophyte Armor
- Obtained from Geeda on Nar Shaddaa (570 credits) <br>
At the beginning, we only have easy access to the Mining Outfit that gives us +1 defense. <br>
We use the Jal Shey Armor then for its defense and dexterity bonus.

**Body 2**: Ossus Keeper Robes
- Obtained as a reward from Queen Talia during Onderon 2. <br>
At the beginning of The Ravager we can swap to the Ossus Keeper Robes for a bigger force point pool, and for better resistance against Sion/Traya’s force powers (+4 Wisdom, +4 Intelligence, +2 Charisma). <br>
Beginners can opt to keep the Jal Shey Neophyte Armor, as it provides more defense for the late game.

**Main Hand**: Single Lightsaber
- Crafted by Bao-Dur after Dantooine <br>
We use a single-handed Lightsaber for use with Critical Strikes later on. At Nar Shaddaa, we will be buying two crystals to upgrade it.

**Crystal 1**: Nextor
- Bought on Nar Shaddaa from Oondar (3580 credits) <br>
Provides a high critical threat range, which makes our critical hits stronger. It also gives a nice +1 to our attack modifier.

**Crystal 2**: Opila
- Bought on Nar Shaddaa from Geeda (2831 credits) <br>
Grants us the Keen effect, which gives us a 10% increased chance to crit. It also adds a flat +3 to damage, and is very cost effective.

**Crystal 3**: Pontite
- Obtained as a reward from Queen Talia during Onderon 2. <br>
Giving us Damage Bonus +1-10 Cold and Charisma +2, this will replace Crystal, Nextor after the Onderon Palace.

**Off-Hand**: Freedon Nadd's Short Lightsaber
- Obtained from Freedon Nadd’s Tomb <br>
This is a very good off-hand weapon that increases our accuracy while having higher damage than other lightsabers. Before that, we will be using a vibroblade, or a offhand lightsaber for damage.

**Belt**: None. Or the best belt you looted <br>
- There are no good guaranteed belts we can purchase for an affordable price. See itemization below for things you are looking for in a belt.

**Shield Slots**: Energy Shield <br>
- The Energy Shield is equipped to mitigate damage from blasters, which is primarily used at Peragus when walking through mines. There are a couple sections in this run where Energy Shields will be helpful for MC and other party members.

The majority of our equipment is attained in Nar Shaddaa. For the early game, we will make use of a pair of Vibroswords, though some exceptions can be made depending on the randomization the shops have.

**Item Prioritization:**
- Due to the RNG nature of loot and shops in this game, sometimes there are better items you might on your way through the early game. You'll want to prioritize it roughly by:

1. +Strength: Strength gives us more damage AND more accuracy, and therefore is much more beneficial to us overall than any other stat.
2. +Damage (any type): More damage is great. Generally this will be in the form of +physical damage (e.g Gamorrean Gloves).
3. +Attack: Gives us more chance of hitting, which is crucial early game since our weapons are weaker.
4. +Wisdom: Gives us better saving throws for the endgame, where Nihilus, Sion, and Traya have the chance to use force powers against us.
5. +Defense: Makes others less likely to hit us. A good stat to look out for since we tend to run through areas with large amounts of enemies.

## Credit Route

We perform 8 shopping trips during the run. Most 'Buy' amounts are the total amount that you will end with in your inventory, make sure to take note of this. The trips are as follows: <br>
1. **Samhan Dobo**; Telos Station <br>
	The first shopping trip of the run will start with Samhan. Please note that at the end of the Telos Station shopping trip we MUST have at minimum 1525 credits to complete the 'High Stakes' quest.
In Samhans shop we will sell the following:

```
- 1x Parts (+55 credits)
- 2x Vibroblades (+208 credits)
- Droid Self-Sustaining Unit (+3300 credits)
```

This will bring our credit total somewhere between 4000 and 4300 credits.
*We are allocating 1550 credits for the bare essentials, although we will usually spend a bit less than that here.*
Next is to buy some essential items that will get us to Dantooine, credits are scarse with the tightness of this route so only buy what you need. We are only buying enough items here to end at the total amount given below:
(e.g. If you have 2 Strength stims and you need 4, only buy 2. This is true for all but the Ion Grenades which we will only buy the 2 of.)

```
- 2x Ion Grenades (-260 credits)
- 3x Frag Grenades (-240 credits)
- 1x Hyper Alacrity (-100 credits)
- 2x Hyper Stamina (-200 credits)
- 6x Alacrity (-300 credits)
- 5x Stamina (-250 credits)
- 4x Strength (-200 credits)

```
This will leave us at a credit total between 2250 and 2750.

2. **Dendis Dobo**; Telos Station <br>
	MUST END WITH +1525 CREDITS!
   	From Dendis we only buy:
   
```
- 15-20 Medpacs <br>
Or less, maintaining above 1525 credits!

```

3. **Adum Larp**; Dantooine <br>
	For the second shopping trip of the run, we are going to stock up on some Medpacs and Stims to get us through to the next one. Plus the Battle stims that will take us through the rest of the run. <br>
	Firstly sell: <br>
 ```
- Exchange Negotiator (+467 credits)
- Benok's Blaster (+660 credits)
```

And buy: <br>

```
- 4x Advanced Medpacs (-320 credits)
- 6x Alacrity (-300 credits)
- 5x Strength (-250 credits)
- 4x Stamina (-200 credits)
- 11x Battle Stim (-1100 credits)
- Medpacs, if <10 buy enough to get to 20 total, if >20 don't buy any.
```

4. **1B-8D**; Onderon <br>
	During Onderon 1 we will come across 1B-8D in part of the quest 'A Doctor's Alibi', we talk to this droid merchant for the quest and then once again in order to enter the shop screen with it. Here we will first of all buy 1 of our 4 needed HK parts for repairing HK-47:

```
- 1x HK Droid Processor (-359 credits)
```

We will also sell the Mandalorian Assault Rifle here as it will give us roughly 1000 more credits than any other merchant along the way in the rest of the run:

```
- Mandalorian Assault Rifle (+5472 credits)
```

5. **Kex**; Dxun <br>
After we are finished with Onderon 1 we will be back at the Mandalorian Ruins, it is here we can shop with Kex and buy some crucial items for the rest of the run. We will only need to purchase enough of these items to end at the total given below:

```
- 30-35 Advanced Medpacs (~ -2400 to -2800 credits)
- 1x Hyper Battle (-200 credits)
- 2x Hyper Strength (-200 credits)
- 15x Alacrity (~ -750 credits)
- 10x Stamina (~ -500 credits)
- 10x Strength (~ -500 credits)
- 10x Average Frag Mines (-2500 credits)
```

Since we sold the Mandalorian Assault Rifle during Onderon 1, we should have plenty of credits at this point and not have to worry about selling any more items for the rest of the run.

6. **Kodin**; Nar Shaddaa <br>
As part of the quest 'Droid Retrieval' we will have to talk to Kodin, at the end of this dialog we will be in the shop interface and we can buy our last HK part!

```
- HK Chassis (-1500 credits)
```

7. **Oondar**; Nar Shaadaa <br>
During our talks with Geeda and Oondar for the quest 'Trade War: Bonus Mission' we will buy the Nextor Crystal from Oondar for our lightsaber:

```
- Nextor Crystal (-3582 credits)
```

We won't do this shop if we manage to loot a 'Crystal, Nextor' from the Crystal Cave on Dantooine.

8. **Geeda**; Nar Shaadaa <br>
Our last shopping trip! And our last talk with Geeda during the quest 'Trade War: Bonus Mission' and also partly completing 'New Trade Routes: Bonus Mission' Geedas shop will have an upgrade and give us the opportunity to buy the following items:

```
- Jal Shey Neophyte Armor (-570 credits)
- Opila Crystal (-2831 credits)
- Power Implant (-1615 credits)
```

At this point in the run, we should have almost all of our endgame items, the last two items will be looted during the Tomb of Freedon Nadd.

Most of our credits come from our completed quests as a part of the run anyway, and a select few guaranteed items. The credits route is a quite tight, but if followed correctly there should be no issues.

A lot of the quests we do we will end up with some sort of credit reward for completion, we tend to have just enough credits if following the route correctly.
A noteable quest that gives us a decent amount of credits would be 'Sensor Search: Bonus Mission' which when we find and return the Atmospheric Sensors to Saedhe we get 3000 credits. 

The guaranteed items we sell are as follows:
1. 1x Parts. Left over from Peragus, helps to fund our first shopping trip
2. 2x Vibroblades. Obtained on Peragus, sold to help fund our stim needs.
3. Droid Self-Sustaining Unit. Obtained from HK-50 on Peragus, this is a big chunk of credits for our shopping trip on Telos.
4. Exchange Negotiator. Obtained from Luxa and is used to help fund our stim needs.
5. Benok's Blaster. Obtained at the same time as the Exchange Negotiator from Luxa and is also used to help fund our stim needs.
6. Mandalorian Blaster Rifle. Obtained from Mandalore the second time we talk to him on Dxun. This needs to happen before we complete the 'Battle Circle' quest. If you don't have this item to sell on Onderon, your run ends.

## Alignment Route

Alignment in KotOR is a sliding scale from 0 to 100, initialized at 50; higher numbers are Light, lower numbers are dark.  Shifts in alignment are determined by a matrix; every alignment-shifting action is classified as Light or Dark, and then assigned a level (either Low, Mid, or High).  The player character (Exile) can either be aligned as Very Dark, Dark, Neutral, Light, or Very Light.  The more opposed your alignment and the action's classification, the more drastic your shift in alignment; for example, a Light-aligned character performing a High Dark action will have a large shift, while a Dark character performing a High Dark action will have a smaller shift.
- There is 81 total alignment shifts in the run to get us to 75 for the Sith Tomb on Korriban.
Here is the alignment route used in the run:

| Aligned | Action | Type | LS/DS | Delta | New | Total Shifts | 
| --- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| Light | Stand up for Visas when talking to Kreia | Low Light | 1/0 | 1 | 78 | 86 |

Alignment is not as important in this game, as we don’t use any equipment restricted by alignment. We do, however, stay on Light Side/Neutral in order to obtain Mira at Nar Shaddaa, as she is used for Goto’s ship segment to pass by the many deadly mines quickly without blowing them up, and to obtain deadly mines for Hanharr 2 later on at Malachor V.  
We also try to get as many LSP as possible during the first half of Nar Shaddaa to get us to 75 Alignment so that we can enter the Sith Tomb on Korriban. The Sith Tomb wont let you enter unless you are at least at 25 or 75 alignment respectively.

## Route Overview

The order in which we visit the planets is as follows:

Peragus -> Telos -> Dantooine -> Dxun/Onderon 1 -> Nar Shaddaa 1-> Korriban -> Dxun/Onderon 2 -> Nar Shaddaa 2 -> Dantooine -> Ravager -> Malachor V

The reasoning for the middle planets:
- We do Dantooine first, as there is little to no combat necessary until the end, and to obtain all the parts for our lightsaber as fast as possible.
- We do Dxun and Onderon 1 straight after since we have a lightsaber we can force jump, and to unlock Geeda’s guaranteed wares that require Dantooine and Onderon 1 to be completed.
- Nar Shaddaa is done next as per our alignment route we need to get to 75 or higher in order to enter the Sith Tomb on Korriban. Plus we want to unlock Geeda’s upgraded wares, which is crucial for our build.
- Next we head to Korriban to find Master Vash and complete the Secret Tomb, if Kreia does not allow you to enter the tomb here then your run ends.
- We go back for Dxun and Onderon 2 as part of the main quest, this only unlocks after completion of another planet, post Dxun/Onderon 1.
- Back to Nar Shaddaa! Finally we get to use the 10 Frag Mines that we bought from Kex on Dxun! These are used in some quite combat intensive segments with Atton and Mira. Plus we have a whole bunch of side quests and main quests to complete here still.

## Detailed Route

This section will describe all the actions needed to take for the Max Quests Glitchless run.
Since we have the option to side with Czerka or the Ithorians on Telos Station, and Czerka has one more quest to complete there, we have implemented two different Telos Routes for the run. Both will be their own seperate sub category and will need to be submitted to the leaderboards with the appropriate information. If completing the run on the Ithorians side, at the end of the run you will have 103 quests complete, versus Czerka being 104.

If no conversation choices are specified, spamming will work (this chooses all 1 options).<br>
\| indicates a break in the conversation. You will have to talk to the person again.<br>
`->` indicates a secondary part to the conversation. This is different from \|  in that the conversation automatically initiates, rather than having to talk to the same person.<br>
`#xY` indicates repeat that option Y times, as in our first conversation with Kreia during our Ebon Hawk to Telos segment.<br>
`#x-` indicates the rest of this conversation uses that particular number, generally used to indicate conversation spam not using 1 (e.g Saedhe's conversation: 2x-)<br>

The Czerka Route completes 1 (ONE) extra quest compared to the Ithorian Route, thus your run will end with a total of 104 completed quests, where the Ithorian route will end with 103.
