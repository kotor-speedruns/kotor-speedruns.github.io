# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords - All Planets Unrestricted Guide

## v2.5: Female Jedi Sentinel or Consular Route (Light Side)

Written by [Redmage08](https://www.speedrun.com/users/Redmage08) and [R4NG3](https://www.speedrun.com/users/R4NG3)

This route defeats Darth Traya on Malachor V as fast as possible;  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends on the last hit on Traya.  A load-removal tool is available for LiveSplit thanks to the community; times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent.  This guide will cover the detailed route of the run.

If you have additional questions, you can check out the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu) There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

## Unrestricted Ruleset

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**
All glitches are allowed in Unrestricted; however, all KotOR speedruns ban the following:
- Abusing the windowed nature of the game to teleport a character (including Super Save Teleports)
- Severe underclocking of one's monitor(under 60hz) to increase Save Teleport distance
- Abusing the load removal to excessively pause the timer
- Loading saves created prior to the run
- Use of mods or other external tools to modify the software in any way
-You MUST end the run with all force forms when you kill Traya.


## General Tips

- If running on any monitor over 60 Hertz (hz), underclock it to 60hz exactly. If not done, your game will hang after combat and restrict you from moving. This is due to this game being made to suit a maximum of 60hz and to not be played exceeding 60 FPS.

- Learn how to swap abilities easily. Shift +# swaps the ability. (e.g shift+1 swaps from Critical Strike to Flurry etc. Shift+4 swaps force powers)
- Watch someone's PB video while going through the notes! This is very important to fundamentally understand the run and how it flows, and learn possible tricks to make your run much faster and smoother.
- Ask the [Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu) questions you have, that’s the fastest way to get an answer!
- Once you understand the fundamentals from these notes, make your own copy of the notes and modify them to your own use. These notes are made detailed for a new player, and once you become more experienced you will need less of the detail in your notes.
- Remember to have fun!

## Route Outline

The order in which we visit planets is as follows:

Peragus -> Telos -> Korriban -> Nar Shaddaa -> Dxun -> Onderon 1 -> Onderon 2 -> Dantooine -> Ravager -> Malachor V

The reasoning for the middle planets:
- We do Korriban first, as there is a forward hotshot, and we need to maintain any force forms we get as per the rules of the category
- We do Nar Shaddaa next as it has another very important forward hotshot and Korriban’s journal remains but any force form we would gather disappears
- We do Dantooine last to go right to the rebuilt Jedi enclave after finishing Vrook.

## Detailed Route

This section will describe all the actions you'll need to take for the run.

Notation:
* `>` indicates a level up to be done
* `}` indicates an inventory/equipment action to be done
* MC indicates the Main Character (aka you/The Exile)

Conversation Notes:
* If no conversation choices are specified, spamming will work (this chooses all 1 options).
* `|` indicates a break in the conversation.  You will have to talk to the person again. As in  *Chodo Habat 3 times: 1spam | 1spam | 1spam*
* `->` indicates a secondary part to the conversation.  This is different from `|` in that the conversation automatically initiates, rather than having to talk to the same person.
* `#xY` indicates repeat that option Y times, as in *Speak to Kreia: 2x7,1,5,1*
* `#x-` indicates the rest of this conversation uses that particular number, generally used to indicate conversation spam not using 1 as in *Op Chano: 1,2x-*
