# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II - The Sith Lords - Any% Unrestricted Guide

**v3.0: Female Jedi Sentinel/Consular Route**

This route defeats Darth Traya on Malachor V as fast as possible.  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black after the final hit on Traya.  A load-removal tool and autosplitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to glasnonck and Xero; times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly with hardware in this game, and saving is frequent.  This guide will cover the detailed route for the run, as well as an alternate route for Citadel Station which requires an extremely difficult [Displaced Load Zone](../Major%20Glitches/Displaced%20Load%20Zone#exchange-dlz).

Finally, if you have additional questions, you can check out the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu).  There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

## Unrestricted Ruleset

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

Any% Unrestricted is the fastest speedrun in KotOR speedrunning, thanks to the power of Dev Tools.

All glitches are allowed in Unrestricted; however, all KotOR speedruns ban the following:
- Abusing the windowed nature of the game to teleport a character (including Super Save Teleports)
- Severe underclocking of one's monitor to increase Save Teleport distance
- Abusing the load removal to excessively pause the timer
- Loading saves created prior to the run
- Use of mods or other external tools to modify the software in any way 

## Guide Organization

Because of the power of the Unrestricted Ruleset, this run skips a huge amount of the game.  Thus, things like alignment, credit/equipment routes, and even character build are either completely irrelevant or only briefly important.  Thus, this guide is instead organized into three main sections that each cover all of the necessary details for the route.

1. *Route Overview* - A general description of the speedrun route, highlighting key skips and glitches used.
2. *Detailed Route* - This section details the character build and route for the standard version of the speedrun, which makes heavy use of the Dev Character and Dev Droid to skip most of the game.
3. *Alternate Citadel Route* - This section details an alternate route for Citadel Station centered around the [Exchange DLZ](../Major%20Glitches/Displaced%20Load%20Zone#exchange-dlz), which is extremely difficult.  While this route is significantly faster, it is only recommended for top runners.

## Route Overview

### Notes on Save Files

This route makes use of several Hotshots, most of which require their own hardsave.  Since KotOR II organizes save files by character, there's no need to make space for or setup save files ahead of time; all saves needed for the run will be made during the run.  In fact, every Hardsave made during the run will be in a new slot.

In addition, some Hotshots ( in KotOR II are sadly inconsistent.  Their consistency seems to be affected by the total number of save files that exist across all characters (among other things).  Many runners report more consistency with around 200-300 saves, but others run with fewer and some run with as many as 900.  You may need to experiment on your own to see what works for your setup.

### Route Outline

The brief outline of the route for the Any% run, including planet order and major skips:

*1. Peragus II*

* Use Hotshots to teleport 3C-FD to Peragus
* Free Atton from his cell
* Use 3C-FD to dock the Harbinger
* Use 3C-FD and a Forward Hotshot to reach the Hangar Level
* Coordinate Warp to the Ebon Hawk
* Pass the turret minigame to escape Peragus II

*2. Citadel Station*

* Coordinate Warp to rescue the Ithorian droid
* Bring the droid to Czerka and make a save
* Reload and bring the droid to the Ithorians
* Talk to Luxa and enter the Exchange
* Forward Hotshot the Czerka Save to the Exchange
* Kill Loppak and Luxa
* Hotshot to talk to Jana and Coordinate Warp to the Czerka hangar

*3. Military Base*

* Use 3C-FD to obtain all party members
* Save Teleport into the Military Base
* Coordinate Warp Bao-Dur and Kreia to the hangar
* Activate the reactor and use AMG to skip the Tank Droid fight
* Board the shuttle to the Polar Region

*4. Polar Academy*

* Coordinate Warp Kreia and 3C-FD to the Polar Academy
* Use 3C-FD to start the endgame
* Kill Atris

*5. The Ravager*

* Board the Ravager
* Coordinate Warp Kreia and Atton to two proton core sites
* Save Teleport Kreia to the other two proton core sites
* Forward Hotshot to Default Spawn Warp MC to Nihilus
* Kill Nihilus and leave the Ravager

*6. Malachor V*

* Coordinate Warp to skip most of Malachor Depths
* Coordinate Warp to skip the entire Trayus Academy
* Use KillBlaster to defeat Darth Traya

Note that the entire middle section of the game is skipped by using 3C-FD in the Polar Academy.

## Character Build and Equipment

Since we use the Dev Character for the vast majority of the run, the character we create at the beginning of the game has no bearing on the run, with two exceptions:

- We want to be a female character to shorten certain dialogue and cutscenes.
- Make sure your character's name has not been used as a character name before; we need a clean save file list for the run.

Most runners use a Female Jedi Consular Quick Character; the randomly generated name will probably be new unless you've done lots and lots of runs.

We use the following aspects of the Dev Character during this run:

- Master Speed: For movement on Citadel Station
- KillBlaster: For all combat
- Rapid Shot: Gives two chances to kill with the KillBlaster during combat instead of one.
- Revitalize: An emergency backup if a party member dies in the Military Base
- Master Heal: Can be used for healing if needed
- Force Storm: Used to slightly speed up the Exchange Fight and can be used on the thugs.

The KillBlaster is duped once to allow a party member to equip one in the Military Base.  The Lightsaber is used to open one door; while it could be used to Force Jump in certain places, by the time that's useful, Save Teleports are the best form of movement.  The Plasma Torch is also used to open one door on Peragus.

## Alternate Citadel Route

### Notes on this Route

The alternate Citadel route sides with the Czerka corporation rather than the Ithorians.  This would be slower, except for a trick known as the Exchange DLZ, which lets us enter the Exchange early.  In the Ithorian route, this doesn't save enough time to be worthwhile, but in the Czerka route, the Exchange DLZ allows us to completely skip talking to Luxa and doing her fetch quests.

This route is therefore faster than the Ithorian route by about 90 seconds, assuming a quick Exchange DLZ.  Unfortunately, the Exchange DLZ is an **extremely** difficult trick due to the geometry of the load zone and the coordinates it occupies.  As a result, only 1 runner have completed a run with this trick to date. For these reasons, the Czerka route is included here rather than in the standard route.

If you decide to do this route, all other sections of the run are identical to the standard route, with the possible exception of save locations in the save list during hotshots.

## Closing

Acknowledgements to: glasnonck, RedMage08, 30Cents, and R4NG3; all of whom dedicated a lot of time and effort into making KotOR II speedrunning what it is today.  This run is a beautifully broken mess thanks to them and glitch hunters: Lane and HotShotWire.
