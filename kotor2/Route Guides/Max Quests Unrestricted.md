Max Quests Guide v3.1: Development Character route[/big]**[/center]
 
[center]Guide by R4NG3[/center]
 
This route completes all 101 main and side quests in the game with no restrictions.
In the case of two quests being mutually exclusive, you just have to complete one or the other. (Such as the Ithorian/Czerka resolutions to Telos Station) 
Dark side or light side conclusions are chosen based on overall speed for the route.
Here is a link to a list of all the quests: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yQhMQOAjv5n2ZcF3x4Oj9sfj49Ielbsq/edit#gid=55939113
 
[section=Route Overview]

***Guide Key
---------------------------***
- A dash will represent any general action. Like moving to a specific area. Casting a force power. Etc. 
—- three dashes in a row will represent more detailed information about the previous line of the guide
¤ this weird symbol will represent a glitch to be performed. 
—¤ will represent more detailed information on the execution of the glitch above it
> A “greater than” sign will represent a level up.

 
***Character Creation
---------------------------***
 
Female Sentinal or Consular - Quick Character
The reason we choose Sentinal or Consular is because they don't get feats at level 2.
We only do one real level up at the very beginning of the game to get Force Speed. Every level up after is an auto-level
 
**Equipment:**
We utilize the Development Character's Lightsaber and Killblaster for most of the run. We do use a plasma torch very briefly at the beginning of the game.
We will also use a glitch to duplicate the Saber and killblaster so we have an extra for a party member.
 
***Credits Route
-------------------***
You barely need money in this route. However, there are two moments that are required to satisfy the credit needs.
On Telos station, you will sell the droid self-sustaining unit to the Duros merchant.
On Dxun, you will loot the skeleton corpse near the Zekkeg in the jungle.
