Any% Guide v1.2: Male Jedi Guardian Route (Light Side)[/big]**[/center]

This route defeats Darth Traya on Malachor V as fast as possible; Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends on reaching Traya's last conversation.  A load-removal tool is available for LiveSplit thanks to glasnonck; times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent.  This guide will cover the character build for the run, as well as a detailed route.

If you have additional questions, you can check out the KotOR Speedrunning Discord which is linked on the game's sidebar on speedrun.com.  There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

[section=Character Build]

[big]***Character Creation***[/big]
We begin as a Male Jedi Guardian; Male characters have around a 45 second advantage to Female characters because they automatically recruit the Handmaiden, while female characters have to go out of their way to recruit the Disciple.  Jedi Guardian is our class for maximum attack power and the Force Jump feat; however, due to a Fake Level Up we will reclass to Jedi Consular a few levels in.

**Initial Attributes**

Str - 18
Dex - 14
Con - 14
Int - 8
Wis - 10
Cha - 8

**Initial Skills**

Stealth - 1
Persuade - 2

**Initial Feat** - Dueling

We are going to focus on melee attacks with a one-handed weapon, so we max out Strength immediately, and get enough Dexterity and Constitution to help us survive.  The final two points are put into Wisdom for a slightly better Will save.

Skills in this run are important mostly for upgrade crafting; the skills from the Fake Level Up are carefully tuned to give us exactly enough Stealth and Repair to craft the necessary Melee Weapon upgrades.  We also get enough Treat Injury to sustain ourselves with medpacs as we sprint past hordes of enemies.

We choose Dueling over Two-Weapon Fighting because our chance to hit is too low to use two weapons effectively.

[big]***Leveling Plan***[/big]

/assets/images/imgur-dump/AojS9fj.png

Our main combat plan is lots of Strength, Master Dueling, Master Critical Strike, and Master Speed, using an upgraded vibroblade/lightsaber.  This gives us three attacks per round with a 40% chance to crit on each attack; with decent luck on the few fights we do, many fights will be one round long.  Dueling and Critical Strike also maximize our chances to hit people, so it's relatively consistent even without good luck on crits.

Levels 4 and 5 are part of a Fake Level Up where we grab all our necessary feats and Force powers for combat.  We use Kreia's levels to give us both Master Speed and Master Valor, which reclasses the MC to a Jedi Consular for the rest of the run.

It's also important to note that you may never reach level 9 in this run.  This isn't a major issue, as the only useful thing we get from that level is Master Dueling for one extra Attack and Damage.

**Skill notes:**

* - The one point in Stealth at the start is necessary to get up to 18 Stealth to craft a melee upgrade.
* - Persuade at the beginning allows us to save a little money when we bribe Corrun Falt to give us access to the Czerka mainframe.  This is actually pretty tight, so we need to cast Valor to get the Persuade to work.
* - We grab Stealth and Repair during the FLU so we can craft the appropriate melee upgrades immediately afterwards.
* - After the FLU, we have all the skills we need, so we just dump them into Persuade after that.


**Feat notes:**

* - We actually do more fights with a vibroblade than a lightsaber, so Focus: Melee Weapons is an important feat to grab early.  We never actually use a lightsaber for a fight, so we grab Toughness to give ourselves a little extra survivability.
* - Critical Strike and Dueling are our main feats; when combined with the upgrades we craft, this creates a quite potent combat core.
* - We grab Empathy to help with one specific Persuade check: Persuading Corrun Falt to aid in stealing Czerka's information for only 500 credits, instead of 1000.  This is important as credits are tight at that part of the run.


**Force Power notes:**

* - Force Speed is the most important skill, giving double movement speed.  Master Speed also grants +2 attacks per round, which is highly important for maximizing our damage and chances to crit.  It also grants +6 to Defense, which is great for our survivability.
* - Force Valor is used to boost stats and saving throws for some Persuade checks and our crafting.  It also helps with survivability and boosts during some tough fights.  Once we obtain Force Enlightenment, this gets cast as part of that, 
* - Force Deflection helps with some survivability by deflecting some of the shots that target us as we run past enemies.
* - Force Aura and Shield help with our survivability as well; however, we never cast this separately.  Instead, it gets cast as part of Force Enlightenment after Dantooine.
* - Battle Meditation is similarly taken to keep menus clean, but can be used to help with some of the late game fights.
* - Force Enlightenment is obtained upon reaching the rebuilt Jedi Enclave.  It automatically casts our highest level of Force Speed, Force Valor, and Force Aura, making it the best and only necessary power for the endgame.
* - If we reach level 9, Affect/Dominate Mind is taken to keep our menus clean.

[section=Equipment Plan]
This section contains the equipment we'll use during the run, as well as where we obtain it.  Equipment is much less important in KotOR II speedruns, so we really only worry about our weapons.

**Armband: MC's Armband** - Found on Harbinger
- This boosts our Constitution by 1, giving us a little more survivability.

**Body: Random Robe** - Bought on Telos
- When shopping on Telos, we buy whatever robe fits into our budget.  We only have about 400-600 spare credits, and the robe doesn't matter that much, so there's nothing wrong with wearing clothes or the Miner's Uniform for the entire run.  Here are some of the possible robes in Sahman's shop, in rough order of preference:

1. Matukai Apprentice Robe: +1 to Str/Dex/Con is very strong for our build, and the robe is quite cheap.
2. (Dark) Padawan Robe: Only +1 Defense, but at 50 Credits doesn't interfere with the rest of the shopping.
3. Jal Shey Neophyte Armor: The +1 Persuade helps with the one Persuade check, but this robe is expensive enough at 600 credits to really put a crimp in our shopping.

**Weapon: Vibrosword** - Crafted on Telos
- We craft both the Vibrosword itself and significant upgrades for it on Citadel Station:
*Upgrades Used:*
- Improved Mullinine Edge: Used for Keen, which combines with Critical Strike to give high chance of crits.  Also +1-4 Slashing Damage doesn't hurt.
- Sonic Discharge Cell Mark II: Used for Massive Criticals +2-12 and +4 Sonic Damage; the -1 Attack is ameliorated by the Dueling feat and the next upgrade.
- Advanced Zabrak Grip: Used for +3 Attack and a +2 Slashing Damage Bonus.  The -2 Defense doesn't really matter; Master Speed helps make up for that.

**Weapon: Lightsaber** - Found/Crafted after Onderon
- We equip this in our secondary weapon slot after defeating Visas on our way off of Dxun; however, it's only ever used for movement (via Force Jumps) and defense for deflecting blaster bolts.  Every fight is done with the upgraded vibroblade.

[section=Credits Route]
We do only one shopping and crafting trip during the run as follows:

**1. Crafting on Citadel Station**
*Breakdown:* Droid Self-Sustaining Unit for ~300 Components
*Create:* Improved Mullinine Edge, Sonic Discharge Cell Mark II, Advanced Zabrak Grip, Vibrosword, Parts

**2. Shopping on Citadel Station**
*Sell:* Nonessential items to reach ~2000 Credits
*Buy:* A Robe (possibly), 1x Hyper Alacrity, 1x Hyper Stamina, up to 3x Adrenal Alacrity, up to 2x Adrenal Stamina, up to 8x Adrenal Strength, 5-6x Frag Grenade, Extra Medpacs
*Keep:* At least 500 Credits

Notice that the only things we buy are medpacs and stims; with the possible exception of a robe, any equipment we use is found during the run.  Because of this, we're able to get by on credits without making any detours.


[section=Alignment Route]
Alignment in KotOR II is a sliding scale from 0 to 100, initialized at 50; higher numbers are Light, lower numbers are dark.  Unlike in KotOR I, many of the alignment shifts in KotOR II have a fixed value, regardless of the character's current alignment; the usual Low/Mid/High Light/Dark actions do exist, but they are much rarer. The main goal of the alignment route in this speedrun is to hit 75 alignment, which causes Visas to appear on the Ebon Hawk the next time we arrive.

Here is the current alignment route used in the run:

/assets/images/imgur-dump/8fHVfyz.png

The most important point in this route is obtaining Opo Chano's droid mechanic credentials.  There are two options: either threaten him, or pay off his debt.  The former option, at that point in the route, loses 4 alignment points, while the latter gains two points.  By getting enough LSP elsewhere in the run, we can take the -4 hit from this, which lets us save the Self-Sustaining Droid Unit for breaking down into components, rather than having to be sold for credits to pay this debt.

Two other notes on the starred actions above:
- The conversation with Kreia upon leaving Peragus has several options that are hardcoded to give +1 LSP.  The conversation chosen hits the maximum of 8 of those for +8 LSP total.
- The conversation with Atris is able to be skipped with a difficult Hard Buffer, which also skips +1 LSP.  If successful, the makeup is to talk to Kreia upon reaching Dxun to get the required LSP.

[section=Route Overview]
This is a brief outline of the route for the Any% run, including planet order and major skips:

**1. Peragus II**

* - Defeat HK-50 to escape to the Harbinger
* - Make it through the Harbinger and Fuel Depot to the Ebon Hawk

**2. Citadel Station**

* - Clip into the Ithorian Hangar to rescue the Ithorian droid
* - Fake Level Up to gain Master Speed, Master Valor, and Master Critical Strike
* - Construct and upgrade weapon; buy stims
* - Clip into the Czerka mainframe to steal their information
* - Use the Ithorian's shuttle to reach the surface of Telos

**3. Telos Surface**

* - Reach and survive the Military Base
* - Take the shuttle to the Polar Academy
* - Regain the Ebon Hawk from Atris

**4. Dxun/Onderon**

* - Gain enough influence with Mandalore to reach Onderon
* - Clear Dhagon Ghent of the murder charge
* - "Meet" with Master Kavar
* - Recruit Mandalore and Visas

**5. Dantooine**

* - Clip into the Rebuilt Jedi Enclave
* - Defeat Atris on Telos

**6. Ravager**

* - Defeat Darth Nihilus on the bridge
* - Plant proton cores to destroy the ship

**7. Malachor V**

* - Reach the Sith Academy
* - Skip the Darth Sion fight
* - Skip the Darth Traya fight

The clip on Dantooine skips the entirety of Nar Shaddaa, Dantooine itself, and Korriban, along with half of Dxun/Onderon.  However, we need the appropriate party members in order to not softlock in the end game:

- Mandalore
- Visas
- Handmaiden/Disciple

Hence, we go to Dxun/Onderon to recruit Mandalore.  We get Visas by reaching 75 alignment and returning to the Ebon Hawk.  And as a male character, the Handmaiden is automatically recruited after Telos. We don't need G0-T0 or Mira/Hanharr at all.

**Malachor Depths:**
> Level to 9:
  - Persuade to 10
  - Master Dueling
  - Affect/Dominate Mind
  - Note: You may never reach level 9
Run/Force Jump to Malachor Depths
- Take these turns: straight, right, left, right, left, right
- That should get you to a bridge you cross
- Then run a little further, take a very sharp right, and go straight 
Run/Force Jump to Trayus Academy
- Take these turns: left, right, right
- This should bring you to a gate
¤ After going through the gate, hard buffer to skip Greater Storm Beast
¤ Hard buffer to skip CS in front of Academy

**Trayus Academy:**
Run/Force Jump through Academy
- At end of first hall, take left door and go through two more doors
- Take door on right, and enter Trayus Crescent
Follow this path until the long room; cast Force Enlightenment here
- We want our speed to wear off at the right time for Sion Skip
After reentering the Academy area, go through two more doors
¤ Save Teleport to skip Darth Sion
- This is a fairly precise teleport, and needs Speed to be worn off
- Use this image to help you line up the teleport:

**Trayus Core:**
¤ Hard buffer past CS in the Core

*If you have the fast-text glitch active, you can attempt the full Traya skip; if not, you can still do the half Traya skip.  Both explanations follow.*

**Full Traya Skip:**
- QUICKSAVE right next to Traya
- Spam 4, Default Action, and mouse clicks
- If you mash fast enough, you'll trigger her middle conversation before the first phase starts AND the ending conversation before the second phase starts.
- This skips the entire fight.  If you fail, just QUICKLOAD and try again

**Half Traya Skip:**
} Swap Weapon to Vibroblade
} First, cast Force Enlightenment and Battle Meditation
} Use all stims
- QUICKSAVE right next to Traya
- Spam 4, Default Action, and mouse clicks
- This should skip Phase 1 of the fight; if you miss, QUICKLOAD
- If she spawns the lightsabers around her, you got the first phase skip
- Then just use Critical Strike to defeat Traya
- If she stuns you, you may want to QUICKLOAD and try again

If you made it this far, congratulations!  Thanks for reading the guide.  Please let indykenobi know if you have any comments or questions (best way to contact is via Twitter).

I'd like to acknowledge glasnonck and thinkshooter, whose runs got me into KotOR speedrunning, as well as glasnonck and redmage, whose runs I learned from and helped shape this guide.  This category has some ridiculous skips in it, so it's pretty fun.  Just hang on through the Military Base...
