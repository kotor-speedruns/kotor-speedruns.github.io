# Spawn Warps



## Autosave Hotshots

**Description:** Autosave Hotshots are a special method that loads an Autosave that has been saved over.  It has some useful special properties but is extremely situational.

**Save Setup:**

- Have an Autosave at the Destination Module
- Have any save (or actually be) in the Start Module.  This should be near a module transition that Autosaves the game, but it does not have to be the same Autosave as in the Destination Module.

**Steps:**

1. Obtain an [AMG](<Anywhere Menu Glitch>) in the Start Module through either a Quick Save or a module transition.  Loading a Hard Save will not allow you to unpause.
2. Open the Options Menu and ensure 'Load Game' and 'Cancel' are highlighted.
3. Press 'Enter'.  This cancels the pop-up and opens the Load Game menu.
4. Unpause the game, then walk blindly into the module transition.
5. After the load, the Load Game Menu should still be there.  Use this to load the Autosave.

**Special Properties:**

- This method of Hotshot works by loading an Autosave that has been overwritten.
- The Autosave Hotshot is the only method of Hotshot that allows you to warp to a module that is not currently in your save file (either due to deletion or merely because it is unvisited).
- The Autosave Hotshot also does not revert your Main Character's stats, equipment, alignment, or experience.
- An Autosave Hotshot can be used to bring Trask off the Endar Spire to any other location.

**Spawn Location Notes:**

- You will spawn in the Destination Module Autosave, but with the file that walked through the Start Module Autosave.  This includes party, character build, inventory and quest progress.
- With one possible exception, you will spawn in the default spawn location for the module.  This is sometimes called a Default Spawn Warp.
- The exception is if you have previously used Return to Hideout/Ebon Hawk in the Destination Module, and use the [Transit Point Storage](#transit-point-storage) glitch described below.  Then you will spawn at the most recent transit point in that module, even if you have since created other transit points in other modules.

## Transit Point Storage

Transit Point Storage is a specialized application of [Autosave Hotshots](#autosave-hotshots), used when you want to return to a specific place in a module even after using fast transit elsewhere.

There are three restrictions:

- Only transit points stored in modules that Autosave upon entry can be warped to.
- Stored transit points can only be warped to from modules that Autosave upon entry.
- The Autosave must be in the module with your stored transit point.  This can be accomplished using a Hard Save in an adjacent module.

**Steps:**

1. When you first visit the module, set the transit point where you want to spawn.
2. When you want to warp to that stored transit point, make sure you are in a module that Autosaves. 
3. Quick Save your current game and load the save described above.
4. Go to the module you want to warp to so that the Autosave triggers, then Quick Load.
5. Return to the Ebon Hawk/Hideout (possibly using a Fast Lane) and activate [AMG](<Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the load.
6. Open the map and click Transit Back.  This replaces the Quit pop-up with the Transit Back pop-up.
7. Switch to the Options Menu and ensure both "OK" and "Load Game" are highlighted using the mouse.
8. Press Enter.  This transits back to the module you Quick Saved in, triggering an Autosave, and opens the Load Game menu.
9. After loading in, use the Load Game menu to load the Autosave.

Notice that steps 5-9 are a modified [Autosave Hotshot](#autosave-hotshots).  It uses fast transit to trigger an Autosave while the Load Menu is open, rather than moving through a load zone.

This glitch can be used to store only one transit point per module, but you can store one for every module and travel there as long as the Autosave conditions are met.
