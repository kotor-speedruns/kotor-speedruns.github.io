## Description

Door Clipping in KotOR is a general term for any method of bypassing a locked door without unlocking it, thereby accessing areas that would normally be inaccessible.  There are two methods for clipping past doors.

## Party Spawn Door Clips

This method allows you to spawn a party member on the other side of a locked door, thereby "clipping" past it.  By standing close to the door at the correct angle and then Returning to the Ebon Hawk, you can cause party members to spawn on the other side of the door when you Transit Back.  Obtaining the correct angle and position can be done in two ways.

### Small Angle Clipping

While the exact angle to stand at varies based on the type of door, Small Angle Clipping is a generally consistent method of getting a good angle for Party Spawn clips, regardless of door type.  To use this method, run into the door so that you are moving just barely either left or right (i.e., at a small angle away from perpendicular to the door.  Then use the Strafe key to run sideways in that same direction a small amount, so that you are almost adjacent to the door.  If done correctly, Returning to the Ebon Hawk and Transiting Back will clip a party member through the door.

This method is the generally preferred method for Party Spawn Door Clips; it is faster and only marginally less consistent than the other method, Partial Door Clips.

### Partial Door Clips

It is possible to partially clip into certain doors, either by using a Quick Save and Quick Load to trick the game into spawning you in the door, or by using party members and leader swapping to force a party member into the door.  This can then make Party Spawn Door Clips more consistent.

While Partial Door Clips can be more consistent than Small Angle Clipping, the difference is too minor for Partial Door Clips to be worth it.  However, a Partial Door Clip is used to enable a major skip on Taris (see Uses below).

### Clipping with Fast Lane

Party Spawn Door Clipping can be done even in situations where fast transit is normally disabled by employing an [AMG](<Anywhere Menu Glitch>) or a [Fast Lane](<Fast Lane>) to bring up the Return to Ebon Hawk dialog, setting up the clip while the dialog box is up, and then using the dialog box to Return to Ebon Hawk and Transit Back.

## Gather Party Warp Clips

The teleportation aspect of [GP Warps](<../Techniques/GP Warp>) means that it is possible to bypass locked doors completely using specific [GP Warps](<../Techniques/GP Warp>).

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ufqDxgQ3LBQ/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ufqDxgQ3LBQ)

These and other similar applications of [GP Warps](<../Techniques/GP Warp>) are considered to be Door Clipping, even if they are not clipping in the traditional sense.  Thus these [GP Warps](<../Techniques/GP Warp>) are banned in all rulesets except Unrestricted.

## Uses

Once used in several places, Door Clipping has been somewhat obsoleted by [Displaced Load Zones](<Displaced Load Zone>) in Unrestricted speedruns.  The following door clips are still used:

1. On Taris, a Partial Door Clip is used to clip the MC into the door to the Vulkar Base, which happens to put them in the right place for a [DLZ](<Displaced Load Zone#vulkar-base-dlz>) into the Vulkar Base.  See the that page for details.
2. On Dantooine, a Party Spawn Door Clip (in combination with a [Fast Lane](<Fast Lane>) to avoid worrying about Kath Hound combat) is used to clip Canderous through the door to the Ruins in the Dantooine Courtyard.  Canderous then uses a [DLZ](<Displaced Load Zone#ruins-entry-dlz>) to enter the Ruins early.
3. On Deck 2 of the Star Forge, a GP Warp Clip is used to skip to the Command Center without defeating the turrets or hacking them.

### Uses as Backups

Door clips can be used as backups to [DLZs](<Displaced Load Zone>) in the following places, at the cost of small to medium amounts of time:

1. A Party Spawn Door Clip or GP Warp Clip can be used to bypass the Force Field on Lehon and enter the Ancient Temple.  The [DLZ](<Displaced Load Zone#temple-entry-dlz>) to enter the temple is fairly easy, but only saves about 5 seconds over an efficient GP Warp Clip.
2. A Party Spawn Door Clip or GP Warp Clip can be used to bypass the Massive Door inside the Lehon Temple and access the Temple Summit.  The [DLZ](<Displaced Load Zone#temple-summit-dlz>) to enter the Temple Summit is difficult, but this backup wastes 25-30 seconds over a good [DLZ](<Displaced Load Zone#temple-summit-dlz>).
