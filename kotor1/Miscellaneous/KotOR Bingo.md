## Introduction

The purpose of a bingo run is to take a 5x5 grid of 25 different tasks and complete a row, column, or diagonal of 5 tasks.  Bingo runs require on-the-fly routing decisions and unique character builds, and thus can be more dynamic than a speedrun of a standard category.  Bingo runs are frequently done as races, but can be done solo as a change of pace or just for fun.

## How to Play

There are two ways to play KotOR Bingo:

### In Browser

We host KotOR Bingo as part of a GitHub repository.  Click for the [board generator](https://kotor-speedruns.github.io/kotor-bingo/kotor-bingo.html)!  This can be used for solo play, or for races using the "Set Seed" field.  This version will always have the most up-to-date task list, so this is the recommended method for bingo.

### Bingosync

KotOR Bingo is also available at [Bingosync](https://bingosync.com/)!  Just visit the webpage and select "Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic" as your game.  Once you have the room set up, you can share it with others for races or just play the board yourself!  

*Note:* The tasklist associated to Bingosync may be out of date compared to the GitHub version above.

Whichever method you choose, once you've got the bingo app downloaded and ready to go, you're ready to start your run.

## Basic Rules

Here is an example Bingo card:

![Image of an example Bingo card, with a 5x5 grid of KotOR tasks](/assets/images/imgur-dump/hoLKmb8.png)

The goal is to finish a row, column, or diagonal of five tasks.  The idea is that all 12 possible rows are of similar difficulty; but every individual bingo card will have some rows which are at least slightly easier than others.  The goal is to pick the fastest row, and complete it as quickly as possible.

When you're ready to go, load up KotOR and, while on the main menu, generate a new card to use for that bingo run.  If you are timing yourself, you start the timer as you click the "New Card" button.  You stop the timer when you have completed the final task in your row, column, or diagonal.  Note that unlike standard KotOR speedruns, the timer starts *before* Character Creation.  This is because different rows on a bingo card may require different character builds.

**Important Notes:** 
- Typically (and in races), there is a two minute countdown from when the card is generated to when runners can begin creating their characters.  This two minute period is so runners can look over the board and decide at least what their character build should be before starting the run.
- KotOR Bingo runs do not require you to beat the game afterwards; many bingo runs will not reach the Star Forge or even obtain all 5 Star Maps.
- All tasks in your row or column must be complete simultaneously at the end of your run.  You cannot complete a task, then later do something that would "uncomplete" it.  An example is "Light or Dark Side Mastery"; you must still have your chosen Mastery active when you finish your other tasks for it to count.

## Choosing a Row

The most important part of a bingo run is choosing which row, column, or diagonal of tasks to attempt to complete.  This is typically done very early in the run, often before creating your character, as certain tasks require certain character builds.  Different runners have different opinions on how to choose rows; some eliminate certain tasks that they don't want to do and look at what's left; others look for tasks that pair well together; still others look at each row one at a time, and try to determine what would be the fastest.

Deciding which row to pick gets easier the more bingos you do.  If you're not sure at first, just pick the row that sounds like the most fun.  The more you learn about the various tasks on the tasklist, the easier it is to determine which ones you like and which ones you'd rather avoid.

## Task Notes

Part of bingo is knowing what each task requires.  A task that seems simple may not be so easy; as an example, the "Vacuum Mask" task actually requires recruiting Dark Side Bastila, and thus is not nearly as easy as the "Circlet of Saresh" task, which just requires access to Kashyyyk.

Below are sections for each general type of task that can appear on a KotOR bingo card.  Each section has general notes for the type of task, then the tasks in that category are listed in alphabetical order with more specific notes where needed.

If you're looking for a task but not sure what category it's in (or just want to find it quickly), I'd recommend using Ctrl+F.  Be aware that some tasks with numbers have an X in place of the number in this list; for example, "8 Different Jedi Robes" would be found under "X Different Jedi Robes".

## Item Tasks

*General Notes:* Any task that simply lists an item, such as "Echani Dueling Shield" or "150 Racing Bonds", requires you to have that item (or items) in your inventory at the end of the run.  These items can be equipped on a character, but you must have access to that character.  Crystals can be placed in a lightsaber, but again you must have access to that lightsaber.

*Specific Tasks:*

**10 Thermal Detonators**
- Note that Mika Dorin's special shop on Korriban sells 10 Thermal Detonators, and Bastila has 10 Thermal Detonators if you join her and the dark side on the Temple Summit on Lehon.  Otherwise, these are looted or sold in smaller amounts.

**15 Tach Glands**
- This is most easily done by making the tach hostile by agreeing to poach them first.  If you also do the Rulan GenoHaradan quest, there are several more tach that appear there as well.

**150 Racing Bonds**
- This requires winning all the Tatooine Swoop Races, completing the "Signing Nico" sidequest for Motta, and Persuading him to give you a bigger reward.

**Bondar Crystal**
- This is available in the Crystal Cave on Dantooine or from the Sith Apprentice who shows up in Dreshdae.

**Both Holocrons**
- This is the Sith Holocron found on Lashowe in the Valley of the Dark Lords, and the holocron from Bastila's father's corpse in the Krayt Dragon's Cave on Tatooine.  Remember these must be in your inventory at the end of the run, so you cannot turn in either of them for their relevant quests!

**Calo Nord's Battle Armor**
- This requires killing and looting Calo when he shows up on one of the Star Map worlds; the fight in Davik's Estate does not allow you to loot the armor (since Calo does not actually die).

**Carbonite Projector Mark II**
- This is obtained from the rogue droid in the Tomb of Marka Ragnos on Korriban, but only if you go through the repair sequence and either disable its programming or cause it to self destruct.

**Circlet of Saresh**
- The circlet can be found on the Ritual Beast in the Lower Shadowlands of Kashyyyk.

**Czerka Corp. Resource ID**
- This is held by Captain Denho on the Great Walkway on Kashyyyk.

**Damind Crystal**
- This held by one of the Dark Jedi who ambush you either in Anchorhead on Tatooine or outside the Wookiee Village on the Great Walkway on Korriban.

**Darth Bandon's Fiber Armor**
- Darth Bandon will ambush you on your next Star Map planet after your third Star Map; kill and loot him to get the armor.

**Darth Revan's Robes**
- These are only found from the Replicator Bin on Deck 2 of the Star Forge, and could cost as many as 26 Computer Spikes to obtain (less based on Computer Use).  They will also only spawn if you are Dark-aligned.

**Davik's War Suit**
- This is unsurprisingly held by Davik Kang in Davik's Estate on Taris.  Note you cannot skip the fight with Davik and Calo if you need to obtain this armor.

**Echani Dueling Shield**
- This is available from the Dark Jedi ambushes on either Tatooine or Kashyyyk, Shaardan's corpse in the Tomb of Ajunta Pall, a Republic Soldier corpse in Kolto Control on Manaan and a Footlocker in the Manaan Sith Base.

**Eralam Crystal**
- This crystal is held by Dak Vesser, who will recognize Juhani in the Valley of the Dark Lords.  He can then be found in Dreshdae.

**Firkrann Crystal**
- The Firkrann Crystal can be found in the Tomb of Tulak Hord or from Lashowe in the Sith Academy.  Lashowe will only have the crystal if you allow her to turn in the holocron herself, and then confront her.

**GenoHaradan Blaster**
- This is the reward for turning in the Zuulan bounty to Hulas.  Zuulan can be found in the Matale Grounds of Dantooine after speaking to Hulas the first time.

**GenoHaradan Power Gloves**
- This is the reward for turning in the Ithorak bounty to Hulas.  Ithorak appears in the Manaan Docking Bay after speaking to Vek in Ahto East.  This bounty is only unlocked after turning in either Lorgal or Zuulan's bounties.

**GenoHaradan Stealth Unit**
- This is the reward for turning in the Vorn bounty to Hulas.  Vorn appears in the Sand People Territory on Tatooine.  This bounty is only unlocked after turning in either Lorgal or Zuulan's bounties.

**GenoHaradan Visor**
- This is the reward for turning in the Rulan bounty to Hulas.  Rulan appears in the Upper Shadowlands on Kashyyyk.  This bounty is only unlocked after turning in either Lorgal or Zuulan's bounties.

**Hulas's GenoHaradan Mesh Armor**
- This requires killing and looting Hulas, which can only be done by completing at least four of the five GenoHaradan quests: either Lorgal or Zuulan, and all of Ithorak, Vorn, and Rulan.  After challenging Hulas on Manaan, he will then ambush you in the Dune Sea.

**ICE Breaker**
- This is granted by the Rodian Prisoner on the Prison Block level of the Leviathan in exchange for freeing him from his cell.

**Jenruax Crystal**
- This is held by Thalia May in the Shyrack Caves on Korriban or a Dark Jedi inside the Manaan Sith Base.

**Luxum Crystal**
- The Luxum Crystal is held by a Dark Jedi Master in the depths of the Manaan Sith Base.  You'll need to gain access to the rear of the base by speaking with Shaelas in Ahto West about the missing Selkath first, or through glitchier means.  It's a challenging fight, so good luck!

**Moisture Vaporators**
- These appear in the Czerka Office shop on Tatooine after speaking with the Sand People Chieftain.  Remember that you cannot then give these to the Sand People, as you need them at the end of your run.

**Naga Sadow's Poison Blade**
- The poison blade is unsurprisingly found in the Tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban, on the other side of the light ring puzzle.

**Nextor Crystal**
- This can be found on a Dark Jedi on the Great Walkway on Kashyyyk, in the Tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban, or on a Dark Jedi on Deck 1 of the Star Forge.

**Opila Crystal**
- This can be found in some rubble in the Eastern Dune Sea on Tatooine, or from Jorak Uln in the Tomb of Tulak Hord on Korriban.

**Qel-Droma Robes**
- These are in the Shyrack Caves on Korriban.

**Raito's Gaderffii**
- This is carried by The Storyteller in the Sand People Enclave.  The storyteller will only appear if you appease the Sand People, then bring the Chieftain a Krayt Dragon Pearl.

**Rubat Crystal**
- This is only available from two Crystal Formations in the Crystal Cave on Dantooine.

**Sapith and Upari Crystals**
- Both of these are available in the Ancient Temple on Lehon; the Sapith Crystal is in Rune-Covered Pillars in both Temple Main Floor and Temple Catacombs, while the Upari Crystal is held by the Sith Master in the Temple Main Floor.

**Saul Karath's Sith Assassin Pistol**
- Saul can be found on the Leviathan Bridge; you'll have to kill him and then loot him after his dramatic death scene.  Note that his pistol is named *Sith Assassin Pistol* but has much better stats than a standard Sith Assassin Pistol.

**Ship Parts**
- Ship Parts are a quest item on Lehon, and can be found either in the Rakatan Settlement in a cell or underneath the wrecked starship in South Beach.

**Sith Medallion**
- In order to keep this item, you must Persuade Yuthura to let you in to the Sith Academy, then return to Dreshdae and obtain it from either the Sith Thugs or the Sith Apprentice.

**Solari Crystal**
- The Solari Crystal is found in the Tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban.  You do not have to equip the crystal.

**Squad Recovery Stim**
- The Squad Recovery Stim is a medpac held by the Dark Jedi that spawn on Deck 1 of the Star Forge near either exit to Deck 2 after watching the cutscene where three Sith kill three Jedi.

**Star Forge Robes**
- These are only found from the Replicator Bin on Deck 2 of the Star Forge, and could cost as many as 26 Computer Spikes to obtain (less based on Computer Use).  They will also only spawn if you are Neutral or Light-aligned.

**Token from Tortured Selkath**
- This is the item that Sasha's former friend drops after begging you to warn Sasha about the Sith during the Missing Selkath quest.  Remember you must keep it in your inventory to finish the task; thus you cannot give it to Sasha.

**Two Krayt Dragon Pearls**
- This requires eliminating the Krayt Dragon in the Eastern Dune Sea on Tatooine, and then killing Komad Fortuna for the second pearl.  Alternatively, you can kill Komad before you escort the banthas and then loot the Krayt Dragon's corpse yourself.

**Vacuum Mask**
- This is only available with Bastila when turning to the dark side on Temple Summit.

**Verpine Prototype Shield**
- This is available from Saul Karath on the Leviathan Bridge, Mika Dorin's special shop in Dreshdae, as a reward for the Invisible Mandalorians quest on Lehon, in a footlocker in the Temple Main Floor, or from Bastila when turning to the Dark Side. 

**Verpine Zal Alloy Mesh**
- This is only available as a reward from Warleader Garn on North Beach for killing the Mandalorians in Temple Exterior.

## Upgrade Tasks

*General Notes:* Any task that begins "Fully Upgraded..." requires you to obtain the specified item and all upgrades for that item type, then place the upgrades in the item at a workbench.  The item must remain in your inventory (or equipped on an available party member) with the upgrades inside until the end of your bingo.

- There are eighteen total sidedeck cards, including the positive, negative and swappable variations of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Note the positive cards come with the main pazaak deck, so you need only find and obtain the negative and swappable versions of each.  So'laa on Dantooine and the Shady Rodian in East Central Ahto City both sell many sidedeck cards

**All 3 Great Hunt Journals**
- This includes:
  - Shaela's Journal, found in the Tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban
  - Duron's Journal, found in the Shyrack Caves on Korriban
  - Guun Han's Journal, found in the Lower Shadowlands on Kashyyyk

**4 Different Deadly Mines**
- This is one Deadly Frag, Flash, Plasma, and Gas Mine each.  Deadly mines can only be recovered, so you need someone with sufficient Awareness to detect them and Demolitions to recover them.  Deadly Mines are most commonly found in Hrakert Station, Kolto Control, the Manaan Sith Base, the Tomb of Naga Sadow, and certain areas of Lehon.

**4 Different Disguises**
- The four disguises are:
  - *Sith Armor*, from a Sith Commander in the North Apartments on Taris
  - *Sand People Outfit*, from many Sand People Warriors on Tatooine
  - *Envirosuit*, from Hrakert Station on Manaan
  - *Space Suit*, from the Command Deck on the Leviathan
- You must keep Sith Armor and the Sand People Outfit despite the game's efforts to remove them from your inventory once you're "done" with them.  The Sith Armor is most easily kept by equipping it to Carth and removing him from the party before entering the Bek Base, and ensuring it is equipped on any party member when you first reach Dantooine.  The Sand People outfit can be kept by just not interacting with them.

**All 4 Sith Lord Artifacts**
- These include:
  - *Naga Sadow's Poison Blade* in the Tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban
  - *Marka Ragnos's Gauntlets* in the Tomb of Marka Ragnos on Korriban

  - *Advanced Flamethrower*, from Rogue Droid on Korriban, and the Prison Block and Command Deck on the Leviathan
  - *Advanced Shield Disruptor*, from Rogue Droid on Korriban
  - *Carbonite Projector Mark II*, from Rogue Droid on Korriban
- Note that the Rogue Droid must be repaired (and either outcome chosen) in order to get the upgrades.

**5 Different Star Map Quest Items**
- For this task you must obtain the quest items corresponding to each Star Map separately.  Thus using the Routine to dupe Star Maps does not fulfill this task.

**6 Different Stealth Generators**
- This requires two GenoHaradan bounties and five Star Maps.  The generators are:
  - *Stealth Field Generator*, many shops, a starter item with 1 or more points in Stealth, or comes with Mission (and other lootable places)
  - *Sound Dampening Stealth Unit*, many shops or the Tomb of Marka Ragnos on Korriban
  - *Advanced Stealth Unit*, Junix Nard in the Tatooine Cantina, Czerka Store on Korriban, or the Temple Main Floor on Lehon

## Quest Tasks

*General Notes:* Any task that begins "Complete..." requires you to complete the listed task(s) so that they show in your journal under the "Completed Quests" tab.  Any completion is valid, so long as it shows up in the journal.

*Specific Tasks:*

**X Completed Quests in Journal**
- These quests must be actively displayed in the "Completed Quests" section of your journal.  When routing these tasks, be aware that quest data is deleted in four places:
  - Taris Quests are deleted when leaving Taris for Dantooine
  - Dantooine Quests are deleted when captured by the Leviathan
  - Most Midgame Quests are deleted when flying to Lehon
  - Most Remaining Quests are deleted when boarding the Ebon Hawk after the events of the Temple Summit on Lehon

Either killing him or showing him evidence of the Sith's true nature completes the quest.

- This requires recruiting Juhani and completing her fifth history conversation.  Xor will then accost you on a Star Map planet, then attack you when you try to depart.

## Character Build Tasks

*General Notes:* Any tasks that lists feats, Force powers, skills, or other character build features must be completed on the main character.  Completing these tasks on a party member does not count.  They also must be permanent; temporarily acquiring them and then losing them (such as during a FLU or via a Hotshot) does not count.

For the purposes of these tasks, *Permanent* means either base points from Attributes or non-timed effects such as equipment or mastery bonuses.  Temporary, timed bonuses such as stims or Force powers do not count for these tasks.

*Specific Tasks:*

**25 Net Stealth Skill**
- This is your Stealth skill after all bonuses and penalties are applied.  Temporary effects such as Force Valor do not count towards this task.

**21 Base Charisma**
- This requires a full investment of 18 at character creation, and then three attribute levels invested as well.  Thus this requires reaching Character Level 12.  Alternately, you can use glitches to "cook" your character while creating them.

**X Permanent Maximum Vitality**
- This will require investment in Constitution or Constitution-boosting equipment and/or the Toughness feats.  Remember that Soldiers and Jedi Guardians get more base Vitality per level.

**X Permanent Maximum Force Points**
- This will require investment in Wisdom and Charisma, or effects that boost these stats.  You'll also want to save as many levels as possible for your Jedi class.  Remember that Jedi Consulars get more FP per level than the other Jedi classes.  Light or Dark Mastery may also help.

**X Permanent Points in All Saves**
- This will require investment in Dexterity, Constitution, and/or Wisdom for Reflex, Fortitude, and Will saves respectively.  Equipment that boosts one or all saves will also help.  A Scout has better base growths than the other two classes, though the effect may be minimal with only a few levels in that class.

**All 3 Armor Proficiency Feats**
- Soldiers get this task for free, while Scouts and Scoundrels would have to spend tasks to achieve it.

**All 3 Force Immunity Feats**
- This task requires being a Jedi Sentinel, as these feats are granted automatically when reaching certain Jedi levels.  The three feats are:
  - Force Immunity: Fear (at Sentinel Level 1)
  - Force Immunity: Stun (at Sentinel Level 6)
  - Force Immunity: Paralysis (at Sentinel Level 12)

**All 3 Implant Feats**
- These must be permanently obtained, not temporarily during a FLU or lost with a Hotshot.  Scouts can get at least some of these feats for free.  You do not have to equip an implant to fulfill this task.

**All Master-Level Blaster Feats**
- This includes:
  - Master Power Blast
  - Master Rapid Shot
  - Master Sniper Shot

**All Skills are Class Skills**
- This task requires a level in Scoundrel and a level in Jedi Consular.

**Destroy Droid (Force Power)**
- This is the third tier Force Power starting with Stun Droid.  This must be on the main player character.

**Equip X Alignment-Restricted Item(s)**
- These require maintaining either light or dark alignment until the end of the run.  If you lose alignment, these items will unequip the next time your game loads (either from a save or from a module transition).
- Valid Light-restricted items include:
  - *Solari Crystal*, from the Tomb of Naga Sadow
  - *Qel-Droma Robes*, from the Shyrack Caves
  - *Circlet of Saresh*, from the Ritual Beast in the Lower Shadowlands
  - *Star Forge Robes*, from the Replicator Bin on the Star Forge
- Valid Dark-restricted items include:
  - *Marka Ragnos's Gauntlets*, from the Tomb of Marka Ragnos
  - *Tulak Hord's Mask*, from the Tomb of Tulak Hord
  - *Darth Revan's Robes*, from the Replicator Bin on the Star Forge

**Improved Scoundrel's Luck**
- You must get this specific feat; Master Scoundrel's Luck does not count, unless you also get Improved Scoundrel's Luck.  This requires being a Scoundrel at the start.

**Level 6 in Two Classes**
- This would be at least level 6 in your starting class (Soldier, Scoundrel, or Scout) and at least level 6 in your Jedi class (Guardian, Sentinel, or Consular).  This level must be permanent; reaching it during a Fake Level Up is not sufficient, and you cannot later lose that level through a Hotshot or other means.

**Master Caution, Empathy, and Gear Head**
- All of these require Character Level 8, so this could be done as early as Character Level 10 without using a FLU. This handy task also gets you +3 to all skills!

**Master Toughness and Master Conditioning**
- Both of these require Character Level 8, so this could be done as early as Character Level 9 without using a FLU.  This will make your character much tougher to take down!

**Three Third-Tier Force Powers**
- Valid Force powers for this task are: 
  - Force Armor
  - Master Speed
  - Master Valor
  - Stasis Field
  - Destroy Droid
  - Force Wave
  - Insanity
  - Force Storm
  - Plague
  - Kill

**Three Permanent Immunities/Maximum Permanent Immunities**
- There are six total immunities that can be obtained:
  - Immunity: Critical Hits
  - Immunity: Mind-Affecting
  - Immunity: Poison
  - Force Immunity: Fear
  - Force Immunity: Stun
  - Force Immunity: Paralysis
- For "Three Permanent Immunities", any three of these are sufficient.  For Maximum Permanent Immunities, note that Immunity: Mind-Affecting covers the same things as Force Immunity: Fear and Force Immunity: Stun, so you can either skip Mind-Affecting or Fear and Stun.  All Force Immunity feats are exclusive to the Jedi Sentinel class.

**Two Weapon Specializations**
- This requires at least one of the Weapon Specialization feats that are exclusive to Soldiers.

**Uncanny Dodge 2**
- This feat is exclusive to Scouts and is usually granted at level 7.

## Kill Tasks

*General Notes:* Any task that begins "Kill..." requires you to kill one or more enemies.  If this task is your last task, timing ends when the final blow is struck.  Some enemies can be killed through a cutscene rather than standard combat.

*Specific Tasks:*

**Defeat Both Defense Droids**
- These are the droids that protect the Star Map in the Lower Shadowlands on Kashyyyk.  You must fail the Rakatan Computer's personality quiz to make them appear.

**Defeat Deadeye Duncan**
- This is obviously the hardest task possible on the bingo board.  You need to defeat him in a duel in the Upper City Cantina on Taris. Good luck!

**Defeat Twitch**
- This is not the streaming platform, but the Dueling Champion in the Upper City Cantina on Taris.  You must beat the previous four duelists before being able to challenge Twitch.

**Kill X Mandalorians**
- These Mandalorians count towards this task:
  - 11 Mandalorians (*not* including the one Grrrwahrr kills) on Kashyyyk
  - 8 Mandalorians (including Sherruk) on Dantooine
  - 6 Mandalorians on Lehon
  - The imprisoned Mandalorian on Korriban
  - Jagi on Tatooine
  - Bendak Starkiller on Taris
  - Hulas' Mandalorian bodyguard on Tatooine

**Kill a Rancor**
- The rancor in the Taris sewers counts, even if you use the synthesized odor to make it eat a grenade.

**Kill Bastila**
- This refers to the battle on the Star Forge.  You must kill her at the end, either through combat or through a cutscene.  If this is your last task, timing ends when the final blow hits in either case.

**Kill Belaya**
- Belaya will confront you at the entrance to the Sith Academy on Korriban if you first killed Juhani in the Grove on Dantooine, and then talked to her about it in the Jedi Enclave.

**Kill Darth Malak**
- This refers to the fight on the Viewing Platform at the end of the game.  This task is complete when the screen turns black after the final hit on Malak, same as the standard timing for full-game speedruns.

**Kill Griff**
- Griff can be killed as soon as he is found in the Sand People Enclave on Tatooine.  Note you must have recruited Mission, talked to her until Lena shows up, and then talked to the Czerka Protocol Officer in the Czerka Office on Tatooine before Griff will be in the Sand People Enclave.

**Kill Jolee and Juhani**
- Juhani can be killed either in the Grove on Dantooine or at the Temple Summit on Lehon when turning to the dark side; Jolee can only be killed at the Temple Summit when turning to the dark side.

**Kill Jorak Uln**
- Jorak Uln can be found in the Tomb of Tulak Hord on Korriban.

**Kill Lashowe, Shaardan, and Mekel**
- This eliminates all competition on Korriban.  They can each be killed as follows:
  - *Lashowe* can be killed after fighting the Tukata in the Valley of the Dark Lord or after letting her turn in the holocron in the Sith Academy.
  - *Shaardan* can be killed in the Tomb of Ajunta Pall when he stops you on the way out.  Giving him a fake sword and letting Uthar kill him counts as long as you watch that cutscene.
  - *Mekel* can be killed after saving him from Jorak Uln in the Tomb of Tulak Hord.  Letting Jorak kill him by giving good answers to his quiz counts.

**Kill Kandon Ark**
- Kandon is one of Brejik's lieutenants, and can be found in the Vulkar Garage.

**Kill Keeper Orsaa**
- Keeper Orsaa is in the Elder Settlement in South Beach on Lehon.

**Kill Kel Algwinn**
- You must kill him yourself; reporting him to Uthar does not count.

**Kill Selven**
- Selven is the assassin that the government has a bounty out for on Taris.  She can be found in the Lower City Apartments (West).

**Kill X Terentatek(s)**
- One terentatek is in the Shyrack Caves on Korriban, two are in the Tomb of Naga Sadow on Korriban, and one is the Ritual Beast in the Lower Shadowlands on Kashyyyk.

**Kill the Albino Kath Hound**
- The Albino Kath Hound is found in the Sandral Grounds on Dantooine.

**Kill the Hive Kinrath**
- The Hive Kinrath inhabits the Crystal Cave on Dantooine.

**Kill the Lavin Thugs**
- These are two Rodians who ambush you outside Kebla Yurt's shop in the Upper City South after you make Gana Lavin mad in the Upper City Cantina.

**Kill The One**
- The One is in the Rakatan Compound in North Beach on Lehon.  You only need to kill him, not any of his minions or rancors.

**Kill the Shyrack Alpha**
- The Shyrack Alpha is in the Tomb of Tulak Hord on Korriban.

**Kill the Trandoshan Smugglers**
- These appear in Suvam Tam's shop after you obtain all five Star Maps and visit his shop at least three times.  You must kill all seven Trandoshans to fulfill this task, but you do not need to talk to Suvam afterwards.

**Kill the Whimpering Locker**
- This is done through a conversation with the person inside the locker near the Envirosuit in Hrakert Station.

## Clear Tasks

*General Notes:* Any task that begins "Clear..." requires you to eliminate all hostile threats from the listed area(s).  Actions such as disabling sentry droids count as eliminating the threat, unless they are still hostile when you approach them.

*Specific Tasks:*

**Clear a Rakatan Settlement**
- This can be either the Warrior Rakata Settlement in the North Beach or the Elder Rakata Settlement in the South Beach.

**Clear Davik's Estate**
- This includes fighting Davik and Calo at the end, so make sure you don't accidentally skip that fight.  Gassing guards using the consoles is allowed.

**Clear the Endar Spire**
- This includes all 24 Sith soldiers, but killing the final five using the console is allowed.

**Clear the Hidden Bek Base**
- This includes both the normally locked areas and Gadon and Kaiera in his office.  Thus you must betray the Beks to finish this task.

**Clear the Leviathan**
- This includes the Prison Block, Command Deck, Bridge, and Hangar.  You must kill Saul Karath instead of skipping the fight, and thus must also kill the Sith Grenadiers and Dark Jedi that spawn in the Command Deck on the way out.

**Clear the Manaan Sith Base**
- This includes the back section, which can only be accessed after speaking with Shaelas in Ahto West about the missing Selkath youths (or via glitches).

**Use T3 to Clear the Prison Block/Use HK to Clear the Prison Block**
- These means clearing the Prison Block level of the Leviathan before rescuing the rest of your party in the Detention Cells.  You must use the specified droid to eliminate all Sith soldiers and technicians, as well as the insane Rodian prisoners.

**Clear the Rakatan Temple**
- This includes the Temple Main Floor, Temple Catacombs, and Bastila on the Temple Summit.

**Clear the Sand People Enclave**
- Note this can be done with or without HK-47.  Make sure you do anything else you need to with the Sand People before attacking them.

**Clear the Shadowlands**
- This includes both the Upper Shadowlands and the Lower Shadowlands.  You do not have to make the tach hostile.

**Clear the Sith Academy**
- This requires neither Yuthura nor Uthar to return to the academy after the events in the Tomb of Naga Sadow.  You must kill the three Sith who accost you outside the academy as well as everyone in it.

**Clear the Taris Sith Base**
- This includes the Assault Droid at the elevator; it cannot be skipped with a glitch.  It also includes the Governor in his office.  The sentry droids can be disabled via Computer Use, and several Sith can be destroyed via Computer Use as well.

**Clear the Vulkar Base**
- This includes both the main floor and the Vulkar Garage.  It does not include the normally inaccessible Vulkar Spice Lab, unless you're doing Randomizer Bingo and have the Spice Lab accessible in your settings.

## Miscellaneous Tasks

*General Notes:* These are tasks that don't fit in other categories.

*Specific Tasks:*

- This requires a female character; you must talk to Yun Genda in the Upper City Cantina to get an invite to his party in the North Apartments.

**Become Sector Champion on Manaan**
- For this task you must complete all three races legitimately; skipping them with AMG or by other means does not count.

**Blow Up Matrik's Apartment**
- Matrik is in the Lower City Apartments (East).  This requires Persuading him to trust you and then giving him the Permacrete Detonator that's available from Kebla Yurt's shop in the Upper City South.

**Buy Any Medpac for 120 Credits**
- Any of the three main medpacs can cost 120 credits in the right circumstances; buying just one of these will be sufficient for this task.  The medpacs are:
  - *Medpac*, poison the kolto source on Manaan to triple the price of medpacs to make a 40-credit Medpac cost 120 credits
  - *Advanced Medpac*, buy the 80-credit Advanced Medpac from Mika's shop, which marks up prices by 50% to 120 credits.  You'll have to sell an Advanced Medpac to Mika before you can buy it.
  - *Life Support Pack*, buy this from any shop giving a 20% discount to make the 150 credit price 120 credits instead.  Shops that can give 20% discounts include Zelka's clinic after giving him the Rakghoul Serum, or Suvam Tam's shop after beating him at Pazaak 10 times.

**Convict Both Rickard and Handon**
- This is the best outcome for the "Murdered Settler" quest on Dantooine, given to you by Bolook in the Grove.  You must investigate thoroughly enough to conclude that both suspects tried to kill the victim.

**Create Any Type of Forge Droid**
- This refers to the Forge Droid Type A-F that can be created using the terminals in the final hallway before the Viewing Platform on the Star Forge.  Any type of droid satisfies this task.

**Deactivate the Steam Vents**
- The Steam Vents exist in the eastern wing of the Manaan Sith Base, and can be deactivated from any terminal via Computer Use, or from a switch on the other side of the Steam Vents.

**Defeat Every Pazaak Player Once**
- This includes defeating these players:
  - *Niklos*, in the Upper City Cantina on Taris
  - *Gelrood*, in Javyar's Cantina on Taris

- This is his third deck.  You must win against his first two decks first, then defeat the tournament deck.

**Defend the Sandcrawler Miners**
- These are in front of the broken-down sandcrawler on Tatooine; you must fend off all waves of the Sand People attacks without losing a miner.

**Discover Zelka Forn's Secret**
- This means getting him to reveal to you the Republic soldiers he has been treating.

**Escape the Leviathan**
- This task completes on the load screen after the fighter skirmish that occurs as you leave the Leviathan.

**Escape the Mind Prison**
- This requires completing the riddle minigame within the Mysterious Box obtained from Lurze Kesh on Korriban.

**Exactly 0 Credits**
- Remember, this must be true at the end of the run.  Losing money in a Pazaak game is one way to do this.

**Force Choke Lorgal**
- You must start the GenoHaradan sidequests by speaking to Senni Vek after obtaining a second Star Map, then Hulas in East Central Ahto City on Manaan.  Lorgal will then appear in the detention area of the Republic Embassy.  Note you must Force Choke him; killing him with Computer Use does not fulfill this task.

**Force Zaalbar to Kill Mission**
- This is the scene on the Lehon Beach after reclaiming the title of Dark Lord.  If this is your last task, timing ends when Mission screams.

**Free X Prisoners**
- There are 19 prisoners available in the game.  For the purposes of this task, prisoners are non-hostile NPCs kept in a cell of some sort.  The available prisoners are:
  - *Zaalbar*, Lower Sewers.  Zaalbar is considered freed once he joins your party.
  - *Duros*, Taris Sith Base.  Solve the puzzle with the wall switches to disable the Duros's cell.
  - *Hudrow*, Davik's Estate.  Destroy the two torture droids, then use the panel to free him.
  - *Shen Matale*, Sandral Estate.  Shen is considered freed regardless of the outcome of the families' confrontation outside Sandral Estate.
  - *Griff*, Sand People Enclave.  For Griff to appear, you must recruit Mission and speak to her after Taris until she mentions Lena and her brother, then speak to the Czerka Officer inside the Czerka Office on Tatooine.
  - *Jawas x3*, Sand People Enclave.  For these to appear, you must speak to Iziz at the Dune Sea gate in Anchorhead first.
  - *Mandalorian*, Sith Academy.  To free this Mandalorian, you must use Computer Use to help him use a catatonic state to fake his death.
  - *Captive x4*, Sith Academy.  These captives can only be freed by killing Uthar so that Yuthura takes over control of the academy.
  - *Sunry*, Ahto West.  Sunry is not considered freed unless he is declared innocent by the judges.
  - *Rodian*, Prison Block.  This rodian can be freed using the Starboard Cell Block key held by the nearby guard.  The hostile Insane Rodians do not count as prisoners.
  - *Elder Warrior*, Rakatan Settlement.  This warrior is considered freed after the cutscene of him running away.
  - *Rakatan Warrior x3*, Elder Settlement.  These warriors can only be freed with the Cell Key held by Researcher Ll'awa, which means you must turn on the Elders either before or after the events on Temple Summit.

**Free Hudrow**
- Hudrow is Davik's former pilot, and can be found incarcerated in Davik's Estate on Taris.

**Free the Mandalorian on Korriban**
- This is the Mandalorian in the Interrogation room of the Sith Academy.  You rescue him by successfully inducing a catatonic state, so that the Sith discard him and he can later wake up.

- This requires recruiting it and succeeding in four successive Repair dialogues with it on the Ebon Hawk.  You'll need 17 net Repair to finish all four.

**Get Banned from Manaan**
- You must be banned by the court after the events in the Hrakert Rift, which requires dealing with the Mother Firaxa Shark in either manner, then getting arrested upon returning to the surface.

**Get Banned from 3 Places**
- There are four total places you could be banned from:
  - Manaan, as described above
  - Wookiee Village, if you install Chuundar as Chieftain by either killing Freyyr in the Shadowlands or siding with Chuundar during the confrontation
  - Sandral Estate, after any completion of the Sandral-Matale Feud
  - Sith Academy, after returning to the Academy without Uthar or Yuthura and leaving towards Dreshdae

**Get Suvam Tam's Pazaak Discount**
- This requires winning 10 hands against Suvam Tam on the Yavin Station.  It does not include any other discount.

**Give Motta the Mysterious Box**
- This is the box obtained from Lurze Kesh in Dreshdae after delivering him the spice.  You do not have to open the box to fulfill this task.  Motta can be found inside Swoop Registration on Tatooine.

**Heal the Bullied Ithorian**
- This Ithorian is being bullied by two kids, and appears outside the North Apartments entrance in Upper City North after gaining access to the Lower City.  To fulfill this task, you must actually give the Ithorian a Medpac, which means you must have a Medpac.

**Help 3 Taris Bounties Escape**
- The three bounties you help escape are the following:
  - Dia by Persuading or bribing Holdan to drop the bounty (and then telling her about it)
  - Largo by giving him 200 Credits
  - Matrik by giving him the Permacrete Detonator so he can fake his death

**Help with Lyn Sekla's Audition**
- This is the dancing audition in Javyar's Cantina.  You must help Lyn to get the job, not sabotage her.

**Install Freyyr as Chieftain**
- This requires killing the Ritual Beast for the blade, defeating Freyyr and showing him the blade, then traveling to the Chieftain's Hall, siding with Freyyr, and killing Chuundar.  This task completes once the "Chieftain in Need" quest completes with the correct resolution.

**Kiss Bastila**
- This requires a male character, and requires you to reach the private conversation on the Ebon Hawk at the end of her quest chain.

**Light or Dark Side Mastery**
- Keep in mind you must maintain your chosen Mastery until the end of the run.  Having it in the middle and then losing it does not count.  Using exploits to duplicate alignment shifts is allowed.

**Niklos Accuses You of Cheating**
- Niklos is in the Upper City Cantina.  You must beat him five more times than he beats you (or 6 times consecutively), then speak to him and he will refuse to play you, calling you a cheater.

    - *Rubat Crystal with Mantle of the Force*
- For the task **Maximum Passive FP Regeneration**, you must equip both the Sith Mask *and* a lightsaber with Mantle of the Force, Damind, and Rubat equipped.  Since only one Mantle is typically available, equipping a second Mantle lightsaber using glitches is not required for this task, and in order to have the maximum you **must** equip the Sith Mask.

**Persuade a Prospective Sith to Leave**
- The prospective Sith stand outside the entrance to the Sith Academy near Mekel.  Persuading any of them to leave will fulfill this task.

**Poison Both Yuthura and Uthar**

  - *Mekel*, by being Persuasive after killing Jorak Uln before Mekel dies in the Tomb of Tulak Hord
  - *Kel Algwinn*, by being Persuasive in the Sith Academy
  - *Dustil Onasi*, by showing him evidence of the Sith's betrayal after triggering his quest through discussions with Carth
  - *Bastila*, on the Star Forge
- Note that Juhani in the Grove on Dantooine does not count; she is merely a fallen Jedi, not a Sith.

**Rescue Tanis**
- This is the hunter in the Dune Sea surrounded by booby-trapped droids.  You must disable enough droids that Tanis survives the encounter and escapes the Dune Sea.

**Return Sasha to Dantooine**
- Sasha is the stowaway that Zaalbar warns you about on the Ebon Hawk.  You must have recruited Zaalbar on Taris for Sasha to appear.  To return her to Dantooine, spend enough time with her to learn her language and then speak to Lur Arka Sulas in the Jedi Enclave.

  - *There is nothing more that remains to be said. Whatever becomes of you and Carth will have to be determined once your destiny is resolved… one way or the other.*

**Romance Juhani**
- This requires all of the following:
  - Being a female main character
  - Speaking to Juhani enough to complete all her personal dialogs *without* alienating her
  - Completing "Threat from Xor" (see its entry in this guide) with any outcome
  - Confronting Bastila on Temple Summit with Juhani in your party and remaining true to the light side
  - Speaking to Juhani before leaving Lehon and reciprocating her affection (the conversation that Juhani starts with *This may be the last time I will have a chance to talk to you...*)

**Sell Sharina's Wraid Plate**
- This must be sold in the Hunting Lodge on Tatooine.  It does not matter how you obtain it.

**Solve the Light Ring Puzzle**
- This is the Tower of Hanoi variant in the Tomb of Naga Sadow.  You must actually solve the puzzle; you cannot skip it with a glitch.

**Star Map: Kashyyyk as Revan**
- You must gain access to the Star Map through the computer recognizing you as Revan.  This means you should not solve the quiz or fight the defense droids.

- His portrait should be greyed out on the Party Select Screen at the end of your run.  In order to strand Zaalbar, you must first have recruited him.

**Tell Dia Her Bounty is Lifted**
- You must learn about Dia's bounty from either Dia or Zax, then either Persuade or pay off Holdan in Javyar's Cantina.  Then tell Dia the good news to complete the task.

**Win 4 Fighter Skirmishes**
- This includes both random skirmishes and plot forced ones (such as the escape from Taris or Leviathan).  You can also use HK-47's simulations to fulfill this task.

**Win All 8 Swoop Races**
- This is two races on Taris (to rescue Bastila), three races on Manaan, and three races on Tatooine.  These races must be won legitimately, and cannot be skipped through glitches.
