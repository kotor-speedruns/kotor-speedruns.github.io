## Introduction

Each of the following tricks or techniques are allowed in all rulesets, including the Glitchless Ruleset.  Most of these are allowed because they are considered either impossible or too cumbersome to avoid within the context of a speedrun.  This guide will describe each trick in detail, including how to perform it, why it is allowed in Glitchless, and where it is used in all KotOR speedruns.

## Duration Glitch

### Description

*Video forthcoming*

Duration Glitch does not exist on the XBox version of KotOR.

### Legality

The only way to avoid Duration Glitch is to either never load a manual save or quick save (which would effectively ban Manual Saves), or to never go through a load zone with a temporary effect active.  Both of these were considered too onerous, and thus Duration Glitch is allowed in Glitchless.

### Uses

Duration Glitch is used in every KotOR speedrun, but is especially valuable in NMG and Glitchless to make a set of stims last for an entire planet.

## Speed Extension

### Description

Speed Extension is a method of using an Adrenal Alacrity to extend the double movement speed effect of Force Speed.  If both effects are active and Force Speed runs out, then the double movement speed effect of Force Speed remains active until the Adrenal Alacrity wears off.  The other effects of Force Speed (including the Defense boost and any extra attacks per round) are not extended.

*Video forthcoming*

### Legality

Speed Extension is allowed in Glitchless because the only way to avoid it is to never use Force Speed and Adrenal Alacrity at the same time.  Since both buffs have other desirable effects (Defense boost and extra attacks from Speed, Dex boost from Alacrity), this was deemed too restrictive and thus this technique is allowed in all speedruns.

### Uses

Speed Extension can be used in several places within the NMG and Glitchless rulesets, but most notably it is used to extend the effect of Force Speed throughout the underwater modules on Manaan, Sea Floor and Hrakert Rift.

## Stunned Combat

### Description

Stunned Combat is a method of attacking while stunned in combat.  By swapping party members to the Stunned member and then immediately queueing combat actions, the Stunned party member will execute those actions as if not stunned.  The debilitated penalty of the Stun still applies.

*Video forthcoming*

### Legality

Stunned Combat was deemed to be too likely to happen accidentally as well as being relatively rare and a minor enough benefit that it was not worth banning in Glitchless.

### Uses

Stunned Combat is mostly used to mitigate bad RNG resulting in Stuns during combat.  However, it can also allow for more aggressive use of AoE Stun effects such as Concussion Grenades, since friendly-fire Stuns can be mitigated through Stunned Combat as well.

## Auto-Level Attributes

### Description

Auto-Level Attributes is a method of getting extra Attribute points at non-standard levels by exploiting an error in the Auto-Level coding.  When checking to see if an Auto-Level should assign an Attribute point, the game only checks the current class level rather than the overall character level.  Thus if the Main Character (MC) has a non-multiple of 4 in their base class, Auto-Leveling when the MC's Jedi level is a multiple of 4 will grant an Attribute point.

*Video forthcoming*

Auto-Level Attributes are usually used to gain extra STR points, as that's where the Jedi Guardian class assigns its Attribute point during an Auto-Level.  The drawback of Auto-Level Attributes is that you lose control over where your Feats, Force Powers, and Skill Points for that level are assigned, but with proper build construction this can be mitigated.  The usual application of this trick (in NMG and Glitchless) is as follows:

1. Select 18 STR at character creation
2. Reach Level 3 in Base Class and become a Jedi Guardian at Level 4, reaching 19 STR
3. Auto-Level at 7; this gives 20 STR, Skill Points depending on your Base Class, the Force Power Stun (unless you already selected it), and no Feat is selected at this level.
4. Manual Level at 8 to reach 21 STR
5. Auto-Level at 11; this gives 22 STR, Skill Points depending on your Base Class, the Force Power Stasis (unless you already selected it), and no Feat is selected at this level.
6. If possible, Manual Level at 12 to reach 23 STR

### Legality

Auto-Level Attributes was deemed to be a quirk of the Auto-Leveling system rather than an outright glitch, and thus is allowed in Glitchless speedruns.

### Uses

Auto-Level Attributes are currently used in All Quests Unrestricted, Any% NMG, and can be used in Any% Glitchless.  AQU actually uses Hotshots to become a Jedi at Level 3, and thus gains an extra STR attribute point at levels 6 and 10, instead of levels 7 and 11.
