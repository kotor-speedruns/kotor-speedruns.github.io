# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - Any% No Major Glitches Guide

### v5.1: Male/Female Scout -> Jedi Guardian Route (Light Side)

This route defeats Malak on the Star Forge as fast as possible without major glitches.  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black at the start of the Malak Death cutscene. A load-removal tool and auto-splitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to [glasnonck](https://www.speedrun.com/users/glasnonck) and [XeroHR](https://www.speedrun.com/users/XeroHR) (results may vary for Windows 11 users); times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent.   This guide will cover the character build for the run, as well as a detailed route.

If you have additional questions, you can check out the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu) which is linked on the game's sidebar on speedrun.com.  There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

## Character Build

### Character Creation

We begin as a Scoundrel; this guide as written can be completed as either a Male or Female character, but Male has the small advantage of an easier time with Persuade checks on Lashowe and Bastila.  

Scoundrel is used because of access to Sneak Attack (plus a small defense bonus from Scoundrel's Luck).  Even though we only get Sneak Attack II, it helps significantly on some important fights.  On becoming a Jedi we'll choose the Jedi Guardian class for maximum attack power, the Force Jump feat, and since we no longer need any skill points.

**Initial Attributes:**
* Str - 18
* Dex - 12
* Con - 14
* Int - 8
* Wis - 8
* Cha - 12

**Initial Skills:**
* Demolitions - 1
* Stealth - 1
* Persuade - 4
* Security - 1
* Save 5 points

**Initial Feat** - Flurry

We are going to focus on melee attacks with a lightsaber, so we max out Strength immediately, and get enough Dexterity and Constitution to help us survive.  The 12 points in Charisma ensure all Persuade checks will succeed without the need for Force Valor; if you really wanted to, you could do 14 Dex and 10 Cha at the cost of needing Force Valor before key Persuade checks with Yuthura, Lashowe, and Bastila.

We sink as many points as we can into Persuade at the start, and the points in both Demolitions and Security are strictly for tricks; 1 point in Demolitions enables the MC to perform Jedi Mine Tricks, while the point in Security is for a door on the Endar Spire.  The point in Stealth guarantees a Stealth Field Generator in the initial footlocker, which we sell for 40 additional credits in the early game.  We do not put points in Treat Injury (TI) because it is not a class skill for Scoundrels, but we will put points in once we become a Jedi Guardian.

We choose Flurry because it's an overall better combat feat for the run; more attacks per round yields more bonus damage from Sneak Attacks.  This build must forgo Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons, but this only matters on Taris and doesn't hurt our chances to hit too much.  We choose Flurry over Two-Weapon Fighting because it takes longer to select, so at level 2 it's faster to pick Two-Weapon Fighting.  Since character creation isn't timed, this is optimal.

### Leveling Plan

| Level | STR | Feats | Powers | Skills |
| --- | --- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 18 | Flurry, *Sneak Attack I, Scoundrel's Luck* | | Demo to 1, Stl to 1, Per to 4, Sec to 1, Save 5 |
| 2 | 18 | Two-Weapon Fighting | | Save All |
| 3 | 18 | *Sneak Attack II* | | Save All |
| 4 | 19 | Improved Two-Weapon Fighting | Affect Mind, Stun Droid | Save All |
| 5 | 19 | | Force Valor | Save All |
| 6 | 19 | Improved Flurry | Burst of Speed | Per to 9, TI to 9 |
| AL7 | *20* | | *Stun* | *Awareness to 1* |
| 8 | 21 | | Disable Droid | Per to 10 |
| 9 | 21 | Master Two-Weapon Fighting | Knight Speed | Per to 11 |
| 10 | 21 | Master Flurry | Knight Valor | Per to 12 |
| AL11 | *22* | | *Stasis* | *Awareness to 2* |

Our main combat plan is lots of Strength, Master Two-Weapon Fighting, Master Flurry, and Knight Speed, using Bastila's Double-bladed Lightsaber as our main weapon.  This gives us multiple attacks that will deal as much damage as possible; we need as many attacks as we can get, since our chance to hit will be relatively low.  We are not guaranteed to hit level 11 in the run, but it makes the Malak fight much more consistent, so we try to kill some extra stuff in Hrakert Station to ensure it.

**Auto-Level Attributes:**
- When Auto-Leveling the MC, the game only checks your Jedi class level when deciding whether to give an attribute point, rather than your overall character level.  That means you can use Auto-Leveling to gain extra points in STR at Jedi levels 4 and 8, which correspond to character levels 7 and 11.  This is why we Auto-Level at 7 and 11, making it to 22 base STR at level 11.

**Skill Notes:**
- We only need 1 point in Demolitions, since all of our Jedi Mine Tricks happen outside of combat.
- We only need 1 point in Stealth for the belt, and 1 point in Security to open one door on the Endar Spire.
- We need Persuade for several conversations:
  1. On Dantooine, we must Persuade Juhani to return to the Jedi.
  2. On Manaan, we must Persuade the scared scientists to lower the force field.
  3. On Korriban, we must Persuade Yuthura to allow us to enter the academy.
  4. On Korriban, we must Persuade Lashowe to ally with us in pursuit of the holocron.
  5. On Korriban, we must Persuade Kel Algwinn to disclose his doubts to us.
  6. On Kashyyyk, we must Persuade the Czerka guards to disclose the codes to the sonic emitters.
- The rest is put into Treat Injury once we are a Jedi to make our medpac use more efficient.

**Feat Notes:**
- Flurry outdoes Critical Strike in the overall run by about 3 combat rounds on average.  The extra attack from Flurry yields more damage in general, but also more Sneak Attack damage when relevant.
- Flurry and Two-Weapon Fighting are our main combat core.  Taking Flurry forces us to skip Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons on Taris, but overall this is better.

**Force Power Notes:**
- Force Speed is the most important Force power, giving double movement speed, although [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) are eventually the fastest form of movement.  Knight Speed also grants +1 attack per round, which is highly important due to our relatively low chance to hit, and to maximize Sneak Attack damage bonus.
- Force Valor is used to boost stats for as many fights as possible.  Knight Valor also gives us Immunity: Poison, which protects against Affliction and Plague on the Star Forge.
- Disable Droid is used to free the Captured Jedi during the Malak fight at the end of the game.  This denies them to Malak, meaning you only have to kill him twice.  It also fills up your Force Points as well, though not your health.
- Affect Mind is used only to avoid landing fees on Manaan, Tatooine, and Kashyyyk.  This lets us afford 2 extra Life Support Packs, plus we don't really need the extra Force Power for anything else.
- The Auto-Level granted powers Stun and Stasis aren't used by MC, but will be used by Bastila and Jolee...

## Equipment Plan

**Head: Verpine Headband** - Found on Dantooine, Casus Sandral's corpse
- This is the most convenient mask to grab, giving +3 to our Will save, which is our weakest.

**Gloves: Strength Enhancer** - Found on Taris, Sith Governor's corpse
- This is used for the +1 Strength, which nets us an extra +1 STR modifier for every relevant fight except the Triple Sith entire run (thanks to Auto-Level Attributes).

**Body: Jedi Knight Robe** - Found on Dantooine, Nemo's remains
- We want to wear robes to allow us to cast our Force powers, and this is the most convenient robe to grab, since we loot Nemo anyway for the Sigil crystal.

**Weapon: Double-bladed Lightsaber** - Found on Taris, Brejik's "corpse"
- We borrow Bastila's lightsaber for the run (and probably give it back afterwards).  The crystals we use are as follows:
  - Sigil Crystal: Placed after Tatooine, used for +1 Attack
  - Opila Crystal: The only other convenient crystal on our route.  The damage boost and massive critical hits makes it worthwhile.  Placed after Tatooine.
  - Solari Crystal: The best crystal in the game and the reason we try to eventually be Light-aligned (see below).  Replaces Opila after Lehon.

**Belt: Nerve Amplifier Belt** - Found on Tatooine, Chewed Twi'lek corpse
- The Nerve Amplifier Belt is a convenient belt that gives the essential Immunity: Mind-Affecting.  We don't have the credits to afford the CNS Strength Enhancer in this run, and this is the next best alternative.

All of our equipment should be equipped once we leave Tatooine, with the exception of the Solari crystal which is placed after Korriban.  We'll also use the Combat Suit, Prototype Vibroblade and a basic Vibroblade while on Taris.

## Credit Route

The new credit route always has exactly three shopping trips.  Our credits all come from either selling items we don't need or looting credits; we also loot some extra corpses to be able to afford all the stims we want on Korriban.

**1. Larrim on Taris**
- Sell: Nonessential items to reach ~926 Credits
- Buy: 2 Concussion Grenades, 1 Battle Stimulant, 4x Minor Mines (200 Credits Left)

**2a. Zelka on Taris**
- Buy: 3x Adrenal Alacrity (50 Credits Left)

**2b. Crattis Yurkal on Dantooine**
- Buy: 2x Adrenal Alacrity

**2c. Selkath Merchant on Manaan**
- Buy: 1x Adrenal Alacrity

**3. Czerka Shop on Korriban**
- Sell: Nonessential items to reach ~3578 Credits
- Buy: 7ish Life Support Pack, 5x Echani Battle Stimulant, 5x All Hyper Adrenal Stims (28 Credits Left)

The second shopping trip depends on whether or not you get a random Alacrity drop on the Endar Spire (possible when recruiting Trask):

- With no Spire Alacrity: Shop with Zelka, skip Dantooine and Manaan
- With a Spire Alacrity but no other random Alacrity on Taris: Skip Zelka, Shop at Dantooine, Skip Manaan
- With a Spire Alacrity AND one other random Alacrity on Taris: Skip Zelka and Dantooine, Shop on Manaan
- It is vanishingly unlikely to get a Spire Alacrity and two other random Alacrities on Taris, but if you do you can skip all three shopping trips

The chance of a random Spire Alacrity is extremely low, so 99 times out of 100 you'll be shopping with Zelka.

## Alignment Route

Alignment in KotOR is a sliding scale from 0 to 100, initialized at 50; higher numbers are Light, lower numbers are dark.  Shifts in alignment are determined by a matrix; every alignment-shifting action is classified as Light or Dark, and then assigned a level (either Low, Mid, or High).  The player character (Revan) can either be aligned as Very Dark, Dark, Neutral, Light, or Very Light.  The more opposed your alignment and the action's classification, the more drastic your shift in alignment; for example, a Light-aligned character performing a High Dark action will have a large shift, while a Dark character performing a High Dark action will have a smaller shift.

Here is the alignment route used in the run:

| Aligned | Action | Type | Delta | New |
| --- | :--- | :--- | --- | --- |
| Neutral | Game Start | -- | 50 | 50 |
| Neutral | Save the alien informant | Low Light | +2 | 52 |
| Neutral | Agree to kill Gadon Thek | Low Dark | -2 | 50 |
| Neutral | Threaten Janice Nall to get T3-M4 | Mid Dark | -4 | 46 |
| Neutral | Persuade Yuthura to admit you to the academy | Low Dark | -2 | 44 |
| Neutral | Snitch on Kel Algwinn to Uthar Wynn | Hardcoded | -5 | 39 |
| Dark | Spare Yuthura Ban | Mid Light | +6 | 45 |
| Neutral |  | Low Light | +2 | 47 |
| Neutral | Stay true to the Light Side on Lehon | High Light | +6 | 53 |
| Neutral |  | Highest Light | 10 | 63 |

*Snitching on Kel Algwinn is for some reason hardcoded to always give -5 alignment.*

The only relevance of alignment in the run is equipping the Solari Crystal.  We must be at 60 alignment or higher (the boundary between Neutral and Light) in order to equip any Light Side restricted equipment.  The Solari crystal is Light Side restricted, as well as being extremely good.  While we used to try and equip the Solari Crystal after Korriban, the only fight that is adversely effected (on average) is the first phase of the Leviathan Malak fight, which goes from an 87% chance of a one-round to a 63.6% chance.  Delaying Solari until after Lehon allows for a much more streamlined alignment route, saving enough time that the small risk of an extra round on Leviathan Malak is justified.

Almost every alignment shift we make is faster than the alternative:
- Rescuing the alien informant is the fastest way to obtain the Sith Armor.
- Agreeing to kill Gadon Thek teleports you to entrance to the Vulkar Base, saving the 45 seconds it takes to run out of the base.
- Threatening Janice Nall to get T3 is the only way to obtain him, because we don't have the 2000 credits (and wouldn't want to spend them if we did).
- Persuading Yuthura is the fastest way into the Sith Academy, and gaining the alignment to be able to Lie to her to avoid this is slower.
- Snitching on Kel Algwinn is part of the fastest way to gain the 5 necessary Prestige points on Korriban, and saves at least a minute over the next fastest option.

The only shift that doesn't save time is sparing Yuthura, which at 2-3 seconds lost is the fastest way to preserve our alignment enough for the big shift on Lehon to make us Light-aligned.

## Route Overview

This is a brief outline of the route for the Any% NMG run, including planet order and smaller skips:

1. **Taris**
  * Reach the Undercity and recruit Mission and Zaalbar to access Vulkar Base
  * Defense Turret Skip to access Vulkar Garage
  * Use Accelerator Warp to exit Vulkar Base
  * Skip the Brejik Fight to rescue Bastila 
  * Recruit T3 to access Sith Base
  * Kill the Sith Governor to get the Launch Codes
  * Steal the Ebon Hawk and escape Taris
2. **Dantooine**
  * Become a Jedi Padawan
  * Redeem Juhani to the light side
  * Find the Star Map in the ancient ruins
3. **Manaan**
  * Raid the Sith Base to recover the Data Module for the Republic
  * [Sonic Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#sonic-buffers>) to skip the Mother Firaxan
  * Find the Star Map on the ocean floor
4. **Tatooine**
  * [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) into the Eastern Dune Sea
  * Skip the Krayt Dragon to obtain the Star Map
5. **Korriban**
  * Inflitrate the Academy
  * Earn five prestige points with Uthar Wynn
  * Find the Star Map in Naga Sadow's Tomb
6. **Leviathan**
  * Rescue the crew using Mission
  * Skip the spacewalk sequence
  * Skip the Saul Karath fight
  * Defeat Darth Malak and escape
7. **Kashyyyk**
  * [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to skip visiting the Wookiee Village
  * Recruit Jolee Bindo to access Lower Shadowlands
  * Find the Star Map in the Lower Shadowlands
  * [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to the Wookiee Village to Return to the Ebon Hawk
8. **Lehon**
  * Rescue the Elder Warrior and obtain Ship Parts
  * Use the Rakatan Ritual to enter the Ancient Temple
  * Defeat Bastila and stay true to the Light Side
  * Repair the Ebon Hawk and fly to the Star Forge
9. **Star Forge**
  * Find and kill Darth Malak

The reasoning for the middle planets:
- Manaan is first because there are no fights we have to win, and thus our relatively weak combat abilities don't matter as much.  In addition, [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) are never effective in the underwater modules, so doing Manaan before they're effective in general lets us save them for other planets.
- Tatooine is second because there's still no combat, but we now have long enough saves that we can [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) across the desert.
- Kashyyyk is done last so we can use a Jedi Mine Trick to skip the Star Map CS; because your identity has already been revealed, the computer conversation is short enough for this to work.
- This leaves Korriban third, which is late enough that we usually reach Level 9 (and Knight Speed) before Uthar and Yuthura.  We also buy top-notch stims and medpacs here to make some later fights easier.

- ***Optional Strat: Upper Sewers [GP Warp](<../Techniques/GP Warp#buffered-gp-warps>)***

  - *To perform this strat:*
    - *Party: Make sure Carth is in and Mission is out*
    - Activate Solo Mode
    - As Carth, open the door behind you to Lower Sewers
    - As MC, run through sewers until just past the Minor Gas Mine and just before the Malfunctioning Droid
    - Quickly swap to Carth and [Buffer GP Warp](<../Techniques/GP Warp#buffered-gp-warps>) to teleport MC to end of sewers
    - Queue up Flurries on the Vulkar Guards, then swap back to Carth
      - We want to eliminate these guards so MC doesn't die while Carth is running
    - Run through sewers to same point as before
    - Swap to MC and [Buffer GP Warp](<../Techniques/GP Warp#buffered-gp-warps>) to teleport Carth to end of sewers

  - If MC is alone, you can try to reach the garage with only 2 turrets stunned. There's about a 35% chance the remaining turret will miss you.
- Activate Solo Mode (if Carth is present)
- If Carth is present, have MC kill both Vulkars in central hallway
- As Carth (or as MC if no Carth):
  - Take hallway on right and enter last door on right

  - Whatever time you get on this race will be beaten by 0.25s by Redros 
- Talk to the Race Coordinator to complete [race two](<../Miscellaneous/Swoop Racing#planet-circuit-lap-2>)
  - You'll need to beat Redros's time on the second race, but your swoop accelerates faster than before
- After talking to the Ithorian but BEFORE Brejik's convo, [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip the Brejik fight
  - The Ithorian's convo is only two dialogs, so click twice then immediately start buffering

- *Stims: Adrenal Strength on Zaalbar*
- Enter Sith Base

### Sith Base

***For most combat in the Sith Base, MC should use Flurry, Zaalbar should use Improved Power Attack, and T3 should use the Shield Disruptor.***

  - If you miss, the conversation is 3,1
- Kill both patrol droids at the end of the first hallway
- Take right hallway and kill patrol droid
- Defeat Sith soldiers in barracks
  - These have higher AC, so T3's Shield Disruptor is particularly useful here
- Loot footlocker for passcard with T3
- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip Assault Droid intro CS
- Assault droid fight:
  - Pause and use a Concussion Grenade on Assault Droid (preferably with T3 or Zaalbar)
    - Whichever party member you buffered with is probably locked into an attack on the Assault Droid, so use a different one
  - MC attacks Assault Droid with Flurry
  - Zaalbar attacks Assault Droid with Improved Power Strike

  - The first disruptor clears out his shield, the rest do 20 damage
- Loot both strongboxes and Sith Governor's corpse for Launch Codes
  - T3 can start to loot these during the fight if the Governor is about to die
- Use T3 to [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) out of the Sith Base

### Escaping Taris

- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) as T3 to the Lower City and Javyar's Cantina

- Hack security terminal: 1,2,2,4,3
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to enter the hangar and reach the Ebon Hawk
- Board the Ebon Hawk, then use a [Map CS Skip](<../Techniques/Map Cutscene Skips>) to Return to Ebon Hawk
  - This skips the cutscenes between Taris and Dantooine, as well as the fighter skirmish 

## Dantooine

These are more effective if you do NOT have Force Speed or Alacrity active, so try to keep it off as much as possible. [Force Skips](<../Techniques/Force Skips>) can still be done by casting Force Speed twice to cancel it.*

### Anchorhead and Dune Sea

- [Force Skip](<../Techniques/Force Skips>) the Czerka Officer
  - You'll end up doing this skip three times; or you can do the conversation: 1,1,5

- Exit to Anchorhead and Enter Czerka Office
- [Force Skip](<../Techniques/Force Skips>) the Duros conversation
- Talk to the Czerka Officer: 1,1,1,3,2

- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) towards the Eastern Dune Sea (left side of sandcrawler)
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) past Eastern Dune Sea loading zone
  - This skips a trigger that prevents you from entering without a map
  - A [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) will also cancel the trigger preventing you from entering the loading zone
- *Party: Add Bastila and Mission*
  - If you're doing the 2-frame QS version of Krayt Skip, only add Bastila
- Enter loading zone from the back to enter Eastern Dune Sea

### Krayt Dragon Skip

- ***Method 1: [Conversation Overlay](<../Techniques/Conversation Overlay>)***
  - *This is the recommended method.  With practice, this method is consistent, but it is roughly 12 seconds slower than a first try 2-frame QS (see Method 2 below)*
  - To perform Krayt Skip this way:
    - [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>)/[Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) from entrance all the way into the Krayt Dragon's cave
      - Make sure your party follows you!
    - Once in the cave, Activate Solo Mode
    - Swap to Bastila and click the rubble to the left of the Krayt Dragon
    - Swap to Mission and position her in this precise location (image coming soon)
      - This position puts Mission as far away from the Dragon as possible while still being able to speak to Bastila
    - Swap to Bastila and loot the rubble for the Opila Crystal
    - Position Bastila in front of the Krayt Dragon in a [precise location](/assets/images/imgur-dump/GGjL3bL.png)
      - Here's [a look at the general spot](/assets/images/imgur-dump/wWAiCqs.png)
      - This position stops the Krayt Dragon in a specific spot during the [Conversation Overlay](<../Techniques/Conversation Overlay>)
    - Swap to MC and [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) just out of the cave
    - Position MC directly behind Mission and where the sand texture changes (see this image (coming soon))
    - Begin the [Conversation Overlay](<../Techniques/Conversation Overlay>):
      - MC talks to Mission; QS and use a mine to cancel movement
      - QL and immediately pause. MC should be running towards Mission.
      - Let MC get about halfway through the last sand texture before the mouth of the cave and pause again
        - This timing will have Mission get temporarily stuck on the MC while running to Bastila
      - Swap to Mission and talk to Bastila while still paused
      - Swap to MC and unpause.  Mission will begin running towards Bastila and the Krayt Dragon CS will start.
      - The [Conversation Overlay](<../Techniques/Conversation Overlay>) should cancel the Krayt CS *after* it starts walking but *before* your party is killed.
        - It is possible for Mission to get stuck on MC for too long and the party to be killed
        - If this happens, click OK, load the QS, and adjust MC's distance from the cave before starting Mission's convo
    - After the interruption, finish Bastila's conversation: 2
    - Deactivate Solo Mode, swap to Bastila and talk to the Krayt Dragon
      - This fixes the dragon in place and you can now move past the right side to the Star Map
- ***Method 2: 2-Frame Quick Save***
  - *This method relies on a 2-frame window between the end of the Krayt Dragon cutscene and the pop-up that kills your party.  While faster than the other method due to easier setup, it is extremely inconsistent and only recommended for the insane or the very advanced.*
  - To perform Krayt Skip this way:
    - [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>)/[Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) from entrance all the way into the Krayt Dragon's cave
      - End this [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) by actually casting Burst of Speed
      - Make sure Bastila follows you!
    - Once in the cave, Activate Solo Mode
    - As MC, loot the rubble to the left of the dragon for Opila Crystal
    - As MC, turn and click the rubble on the opposite side of the cave near its mouth
    - Swap to Bastila and [position her](/assets/images/imgur-dump/GGjL3bL.png) [in front of the Krayt Dragon](/assets/images/imgur-dump/wWAiCqs.png)
      - This is the same position as depicted above
    - Swap to MC and run up to the mouth of the cave, then QS
    - Run forward to start the cutscene and watch it
    - QS during the 2-frame window following the CS but before the death pop-up
      - This is a 2-frame window at 60 FPS. Good luck!
      - If you miss it, click OK, load the QS, and run forward to try again
      - Each try costs 14.5 seconds; 2nd try is slightly slower than Method 1, while anything else loses significant time
      - If you succeed, click OK and load the QS
    - Deactivate Solo Mode, swap to Bastila and talk to the Krayt Dragon to fix it in place

### Leaving Tatooine

- Loot the chewed Twi'lek corpse for the Nerve Amplifier Belt
  - If you can't loot this corpse, Bastila's position was slightly off
  - You can buy a Nerve Amplifier Belt from Mic'Tunan'Jus Orgu in the Tatooine Docking Bay, but it changes your shopping on Korriban (see below)
- Use [JMT](<../Techniques/Jedi Mine Trick>) to skip the Star Map CS

  - This is mostly useful for distracting the tukatas/Lashowe to get Sneak Attacks in; this can be the difference between one-round and two-round tukatas
- Kill the Tukatas
- Lashowe confronts you: 2,3
- Kill Lashowe and loot her corpse for Holocron
- Return to Ebon Hawk
  - If you added Juhani and Zaalbar for the fight, remove them while returning
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) back to Sith Academy
  - Make sure you skip triggers for Shaardan (if needed), the Sith Apprentice, and the Sith Thugs
  - If at any time you think you've triggered one, you can [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) to skip it
- Re-enter the Academy through Sith Academy Entrance
- Talk to Uthar Wynn: 3,1,4,3,3,2,3,4,4,X,4,2,2,4
  - The X is a variable answer based on one of three questions he asks after the Sith Code
  - Answers are:
    - There is nothing worse than love: 2. False
    - Victory by any means is desirable: 2. False
    - It is our passion that fuels the Force: 1. True
- Run backwards and click on Uthar to use [JMT](<../Techniques/Jedi Mine Trick>) on his conversation
  - You'll need to mash through 3,1 and then several clicks so that he congratulates you on getting enough prestige before the mine cancels the convo
  - This skips being sent back to your room, saving around 10 seconds
- Talk to Uthar again: 3

### Tomb of Naga Sadow

- Uthar instructs you in the tomb: 4
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) at first door to skip Wraid spawn
- Take right fork and open door
- [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) to skip door closing CS
- Open door and loot Pillar of Ice
- On way out, loot Skeletal Human Remains for Solari crystal
- Return to central branch and freeze acid pool
- Open door to map room, then *Force: Cast Burst of (or Knight) Speed*
- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip Star Map CS
  - This is a tricky buffer because the trigger for the CS is very small; we use Speed to shorten our teleport distance
  - Run backwards until you hit the rubble in the middle of the path, then buffer forward from there
  - You should hear the Star Map begin to open if you hit the trigger
  - As an alternative, you can deactivate V-Sync for the buffer, then reactivate it afterwards
- Loot Sith Statue for Sith Lightsaber
- `Level to 9: Persuade to 12, Master Two-Weapon, Knight Speed`
  - You may not have this level available if you didn't get enough extra XP in Hrakert Station
- *Force: Cast Force Valor and Knight Speed*
- Uthar accosts you: 5,1
- Kill Uthar and Yuthura accosts you: 1
  - Remember to swap combat actions to Flurry before attacking Uthar!
- Defeat Yuthura and spare her: 3,2
  - Sparing her prevents the academy from going hostile and preserves our alignment for the Solari crystal later
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) back to the academy
- After entering the academy, immediately leave and Return to Ebon Hawk to board
- If you haven't already, `Level to 9: Persuade to 12, Master Two-Weapon, Knight Speed`
- Fly to Kashyyyk (no Map CS Skip)

## The Leviathan

### Detention

- Carth whines at you on the Ebon Hawk: 1,1,1,2
- Saul Karath's interrogation scene
- IMMEDIATELY AFTER, [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip Mission's prison break CS
- As Mission:
  - [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) and take door at end of left hallway
  - Loot footlocker for Sith Passcard AND 3 Computer Spikes
  - [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) all the way to the Detention Center
  - Activate the terminal
- As MC, loot rightmost locker
- *Equip MC:*
  - *Verpine Headband*
  - *Strength Gauntlets*
  - *Jedi Knight Robe*
  - *Nerve Amplifier Belt*
  - *Double-Bladed Lightsaber*
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to the elevator to Bridge: 2

### Bridge

*For the rest of the Leviathan, you have to keep Carth and Bastila close to you in order to go through loading zones.  Do your best to make sure they don't wander off, as that can and will lose you a lot of time.  It can help to QS/QL here, and you may wish to use Speed for movement for consistentcy.*

- Turn right and kill guard
  - It's possible to run past this guard without killing him
  - However, there's a small chance he'll shoot at Carth/Bastila and aggro them
- Turn left at the end of the hall; make sure Carth and Bastila are following you here
- Take first hallway on left, then immediately bash down armory door on the right
  - If you're too slow, the Sith Guard here will aggro Carth and/or Bastila
- Get the Space Suits from the floor
- Bash down the door across the armory
- QS before door across the hall
- Run through next room, bash down door, and enter bridge storage
  - If you get stunned or your party wanders off, QL and retry
- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip the spacewalk
  - Click the door, QS once, then QL
  - Done perfectly, you can run through the space section without any trouble
  - If that fails, the door may look open but be closed and solid (if your QS was slightly late)
  - If that happens, QS/QL and you can open the door without donning the suit
- Once on the other side, Activate Solo Mode
- As Carth and Bastila, [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) through the door on the right
  - Tuck them in the corner to attempt to deaggro them
  - The goal is to have them stay close enough to the exit while you do Saul Karath skip
- Swap back to MC and [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) up to bridge door
- Saul Karath Skip:
  - ***Optional:** Hard Save for safety; it is possible to softlock here
  - This trick is a [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>), but the timing is quite precise
  - Open Bridge Door and QS twice, then load immediately
  - If the trick works, the bridge door will be open, the fight will not start, and Bastila and Carth will be in your party
  - If Bastila and Carth are not in your party, you've softlocked
  - If your last QS was too late, your game will crash when you load
- Once successful, hack bridge terminal: 1,2
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to the exit
  - Bastila and Carth may be dead; if they're still on the farther half of the room that's fine
  - If they died closer to the bridge, you'll have to kill the five soldiers to revive them
- Back on the Command Deck, *Medpacs: Everyone as needed*
- *Force: Cast Knight Speed on MC*
- Kill the Sith guard nearby to the left
- Swap to Bastila (or Carth) and QS/QL to get party to follow
- Take left path and [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) around outside back to elevator
  - With quick, precise [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>), it's possible to skip killing the two guards right outside the elevator
  - If either Carth or Bastila aggros on them, you'll likely have to kill them
  - Or you can use Solo Mode and [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to try to get everyone into the elevator
- Take the elevator to the Hangar: 3

### Hangar

- Activate Solo Mode
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) straight through to the Darth Malak CS
- *Stims/Force: Cast Knight Speed and Force Valor, Hyper Stim Suite on MC*
  - **Hyper Stim Suite** is Hyper Alacrity, Hyper Strength, Hyper Stamina, and Echani Battle Stim
- Darth Malak accosts you
- Plot twist!
- Darth Malak accosts you again: 1,1,1,1,2,1,4,1
- Darth Malak fight:
  - For both phases, swap combat feats to Flurry while running slightly past him to one side
  - Use Flurry once next to or slightly behind him to get Sneak Attacks off while he uses Force Resistance
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) through blast doors after Malak flees
  - *Force: Cast Knight Speed and Force Valor, Hyper Stim Suite on MC*
  - If you had to buy fewer stims on Korriban, don't use any stims here
- Darth Malak fight, part two
- Bastila sacrifices herself, sort of
- Leave with Carth through blast doors on left
- Shoot down the Sith fighters
- Talk to the party on the ship
- Exit the ship after the sleeping CS

## Kashyyyk

### The Great Walkway

- Janos Wertka accosts you
  - You can [Force Skip](<../Techniques/Force Skips>) this, but you'll have to do it again twice later
- [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) from lower level to door to Great Walkway
  - This skips a conversation with Ziagrom and the Czerka guard at the end
- *Party: Add T3*
- Exit to Great Walkway
- Activate Solo Mode to leave T3 at landing pad
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to skip Czerka patrol
  - If you talk to them the convo is just 5
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) along walkway until you reach the Wookiee Guard
  - You can also Force Jump where able, but be aware it will sometimes target enemies behind you
- [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>)/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) past the Wookiee Guard
  - This skips a trigger that forces you to visit the Wookiee Village first
- Swap to T3 and [Buffer GP Warp](<../Techniques/GP Warp#buffered-gp-warps>) the MC to the elevator
- Take elevator to Upper Shadowlands

### Upper Shadowlands

- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to skip Katarn Spawn
  - An easy visual cue is to QS when you reach the hanging vine
- Jolee Bindo greets you
- Continue to the fork, then Activate Solo Mode
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) with T3 to Jolee's House
- With MC, take left path and [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to Czerka guards
  - If the captain speaks to you, convo is 1,4; you can also try to [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) this
- Talk to first Czerka guard: 1,1,3,1,2
- Hack the sonic emitter next to that guard
- Talk to second Czerka guard: 1,1,2
- Hack the sonic emitter next to that guard
- IMMEDIATELY AFTER, [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) to skip the terentatek CS
  - Avoid casting Knight Speed here to preserve [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>)
- Swap to T3 and speak with Jolee from a distance, then swap back to MC before the convo: 1,1,1,1,2,3,1,1,1,1,1
  - *Party: Keep Jolee when prompted*
  - If you didn't manage to swap to MC before the convo, add T3 again 
- As MC (or swap to T3) and [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to Force Field: 1,2

### Lower Shadowlands

- Activate Solo Mode
- [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) or [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to skip the Mandalorian CS
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to skip a kinrath spawn
  - If you miss it, kill the Kinrath, because we'll have to return with Jolee and T3
  - Try to QS a few steps after the hanging vine
- Deactivate Solo Mode near the Star Map Computer
- Use [JMT](<../Techniques/Jedi Mine Trick>) on the Star Map Computer: 2
  - You need to spam through the conversation so that the Star Map starts to open before the mine cancels the convo
  - You should now be out of mines
- Jolee (and possibly T3) teleport to you
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) back to Upper Shadowlands
  - Make sure your party follows you out!

### Leaving Kashyyyk

- Activate Solo Mode
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to Gorwooken
- Speak to Gorwooken to reach the Great Walkway
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to Wookiee Village
  - [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) to skip the Dark Jedi fight if needed
- Wookiee Guard accosts you: 1,1,1
- Immediately after loading, [Map CS Skip](<../Techniques/Map Cutscene Skips>) to Return to Ebon Hawk and board
  - [Force Skip](<../Techniques/Force Skips>) Janos Wertka's convo after loading if you did before
- Fly to Star Forge System (Lehon) with a [Map CS Skip](<../Techniques/Map Cutscene Skips>)
  - [Force Skip](<../Techniques/Force Skips>) Janos Wertka's convo after the [Map CS Skip](<../Techniques/Map Cutscene Skips>) if you did before
  - Reboard Ebon Hawk and fly to Lehon again (no Map CS Skip)
  - Sometimes you'll have to shoot down some Sith fighters; whether or not this triggers is sadly random

## Lehon

*[Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) are again very useful for movement on Lehon.  Be careful not to overuse them, as we want to avoid game crashes.*

### Beaches

- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to Temple Exterior
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) through Temple Exterior to South Beach
- Return to Ebon Hawk and Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to North Beach
- Rakatan Warriors accost you
- Speak with The One: 1,1,1,1,1,4,4
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) straight to Elder Warrior without entering combat and talk to him
  - If you enter combat accidentally, use [Combat Talking](<../Techniques/Combat Talking>) to talk to the Elder Warrior
- `Level to 10: Persuade to 12, Master Flurry, Knight Valor`
- Loot Ship Parts from opposite cell
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) out of Rakatan Compound
- [Force Skip](<../Techniques/Force Skips>) short walking cutscene outside
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to Central Beach
- Transit Back to South Beach
- [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) to skip gizka death scene
- Enter Elder Rakatan Compound
- Speak with Rakatan Elders
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) back to Temple Exterior
- Begin the Rakatan ritual to enter the temple
- After the CS ends but before the load into the STUNT module, QS
  - You should mash QS as the party runs towards the temple
  - Kill the program with either ALT+F4 or Task Manager, then reload the QS
  - This skips the Malak cutscene and acts as the final memory clear
- *Party: Remove Juhani, Add Canderous*
  - This enables a quicker escape to the Ebon Hawk later
- Enter the Temple

### Ancient Temple

- Activate Solo Mode; make sure Jolee and Canderous stay right near the entrance
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to temple basement in back
- *Stims/Force: Hyper Stim Suite on MC, Cast Knight Speed and Knight Valor*
- Kill both guard droids in basement
- Solve floor puzzle with [this H-shaped path](/assets/images/imgur-dump/CF497Fm.png)
- Speak to basement computer: 1,1,2,1,2
- Return to main floor
- Activate Solo Mode
- ***Optional:** Deactivate V-Sync to make the next [GP Warp](<../Techniques/GP Warp#buffered-gp-warps>) easier*
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) MC once up the ramp, then swap party members twice
- [Buffer GP Warp](<../Techniques/GP Warp#buffered-gp-warps>) by hitting the load zone, then swapping to the MC
- Enter Temple Summit
  - Re-enable V-Sync if you disabled it before
- Talk to and defeat Darth Waifu
  - You can try to get behind her for Sneak Attacks, but even with that this fight is nearly always 2 rounds
- Choose to remain true to the light side
  - This is faster than the Dark Side ending; no party members on Star Forge to get in the way
- Hack computer terminal to lower disruptor field
- Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) back to the main floor, but enter with Canderous
- As Canderous, Run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) out of the temple and back to Central Beach
  - Make sure your party follows you in Temple Exterior; if you spend too long there, a STUNT CS will trigger!
- As soon as you reach the Central Beach, board the nearby Ebon Hawk as Canderous
  - Canderous teleports to be there for the CS outside the Ebon Hawk, but stays in your party
  - If it says you're in combat, move Jolee and MC as far away from the Rakatan Warriors as possible and try again
  - If it still says you're in combat, MC will have to kill the Rakatan warriors before Canderous can board
- **Upgrade Double-Bladed Lightsaber: Replace Opila with Solari**
- Repair the hyperdrive on the Ebon Hawk
- Fly to the Star Forge

## The Star Forge

*Note: The game has now deleted data so that your [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) are greatly weakened.  It's fastest to use Knight Speed and Force Jump for movement on the Star Forge.*

### Deck 1

- Exit the Ebon Hawk
- [Force Skip](<../Techniques/Force Skips>) Jedi vs. Sith CS
- [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) to skip Assault Droid CS and spawn
- Go right, then left
  - To get past the two frozen assault droids, click on the distant door and watch the wonders of KotOR pathing
- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) past Jedi vs. Sith CS
- *Force/Stims: Cast Knight Valor, Use Hyper Stim Suite as you enter Deck 2*

### Deck 2

- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) past fight trigger
- ***Optional**: [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) past the enemy spawn trigger (Indy Skip)*
  - This skips the trigger that spawns all the enemies in the hallways ahead of you
  - No enemies means you're much less likely to be debilitated by an enemy Force Power
  - However, it also means you have no enemies to Force Jump to, so this is slightly slower than the best case scenario 
- Take left path, then right, then turn left
- Hack computer terminal: 1,1,5
- Return and take elevator to Command Deck

### Command Deck

- Immediately after loading, [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip Bastila/Malak CS
- Run/Force Jump through first door on left, then two more doors
- Ensure all six buffs are active
- [Open Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#open-buffers>) into the triple Dark Jedi fight
  - DO NOT [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>); this will softlock the game
  - This [Open Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#open-buffers>) messes with the Dark Jedi AI so they won't attack you unless you attack them first
- Defeat three Dark Jedi to unseal the door
  - Kill the center one first, then try to get behind the other two before attacking them for Sneak Attacks
  - Remember to swap to Flurry before attacking!
- `If you hit Level 11, Auto-Level MC to reach 22 STR` 
- Darth Waifu fight
  - *As a male MC with 12 Persuade*, you can spam all conversations after the first
  - *As a female MC or with less than 12 Persuade*, use the given conversations to guarantee sparing Bastila
  - First conversation: 2
  - First fight phase (use Flurry for all phases; try to make sure Speed stays active)
    - You can again run slightly past her on the right while she uses Force Resistance to get Sneak Attacks
  - Second conversation: 2, 2, 1
    - Spam default action during this convo to immediately talk to Bastila and skip phase 2
    - If you fail to skip it, just attack Bastila
  - Third conversation: 2, 2 (if you got the phase skip, this convo is also skipped)
    - Do NOT spam default action here; if you talk to Bastila again, it's a softlock
  - Defeat her last phase
    - If your Knight Speed and/or Valor wore off here, it's not worth casting them again until after the fight
  - Last conversation
    - *As a male character without enough Persuade*: 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
    - *As a female character*: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1
- After the load but before the cutscene on the Harbinger, activate a [Map CS Skip](<../Techniques/Map Cutscene Skips>):
  - *Party: Add Jolee and Bastila*
  - Close the menu and watch the cutscene
- *Force: Cast Knight Speed*
- Run through door on right
- As you approach the next door, [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) to skip the Darth Malak conversation
  - End this [Soft Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#soft-buffers>) by actually casting Knight Valor
  - To get to the elevator, run all party members towards the corner near the left Jedi and switch party leaders
  - One of your characters will end up next to the elevator door; take it to the Viewing Platform

### Darth Malak Fight

- Phase One, Stasis Strat:
  - QS just before triggering the fight
  - Malak convo: 2
  - IMMEDIATELY after his weapon flourish CS, pause the game
  - If Malak already has a blue aura around him (Force Immunity), load the QS and try again
  - If Malak hasn't cast Force Immunity yet, queue two Stasis casts with both Jolee and Bastila
  - Swap to MC and swap combat feats to Flurry, then unpause, get behind him, and Flurry away
  - The Stasis casts will always be saved, but each one slows Malak, reducing his AC by 4 each for a total of -16
  - The makes the first phase a fairly consistent 2-3 round fight
- Phase Two, The Jedi Popsicles:
  - As Malak runs to absorb the first Dead Jedi, Activate Solo Mode and run either Jolee or Bastila towards the opposite side
  - Mash the cutscene, then *Force: Burst of Speed as Jolee/Bastila*
  - Use Disable Droid on the four Dead Jedi on that side with Jolee/Bastila
  - Swap to MC and use Disable Droid on the three remaining Dead Jedi on the opposite side
    - Using MC prevents Malak from losing too much health, which would trigger another absorption CS
  - *Force: Recast Knight Speed and Knight Valor if needed*
    - These have frequently been cancelled by Malak's Force Breach
  - Kill Malak once and for all
    - Bastila and Jolee can distract Malak to enable Sneak Attacks, but his Force Immunity lasts 60 seconds, so Stasis won't work
    - This last part is RNG heavy, as you only have a 50% chance to hit Malak

## Closing

If you made it this far, congratulations!  Thanks for reading the guide.  Please let indykenobi know if you have any comments or questions (best way to contact is via the KotOR Speedrunning Discord).

I'd like to acknowledge glasnonck and thinkshooter, whose runs got me into KotOR speedrunning, as well as glasnonck, sheepmetal, and wurwilf, who all discussed this category before it was implemented.

Just remember, Pazaak is not for everyone.
