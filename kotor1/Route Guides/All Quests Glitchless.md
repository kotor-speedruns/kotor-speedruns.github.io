# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - All Quests Glitchless Guide 

### v3.4: Male Scout -> Jedi Guardian Route

*Route and Guide by [indykenobi](https://www.speedrun.com/users/indykenobi)*

This route completes all 100 main and side quests in the game without the benefit of glitches.  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black at the start of the Malak Death cutscene. A load-removal tool and auto-splitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to [Lane](https://www.speedrun.com/users/Lane), [glasnonck](https://www.speedrun.com/users/glasnonck) and [XeroHR](https://www.speedrun.com/users/XeroHR). Times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and there are frequent load screens. 

Dark side or light side quest conclusions are chosen based on overall speed for the route.  This guide will cover the character creation and leveling choices, as well as reasoning for each quest's chosen completion and a detailed route.

## Category Rules

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

### All Quests Category

For All Quests runs, you must complete the game with either ending on any difficulty, and complete all 100 quests. Completing a quest is defined as any of the following three conditions:

1. The quest appears in the "Completed Quests" section of the journal.
2. If the quest is entirely removed from the journal when completed, it must appear in the "Active Quests" section of the journal first.
3. If a quest is completed but then becomes active again, it must be completed again.

Out of the 100 quests, 91 of them can at some point be moved to the "Completed Quests" section of the Journal and thus satisfy condition 1.  

The quest "The Jedi Council" is (with the current route) the only quest that reactivates and thus falls under condition 3.  It is completed both times by satisfying condition 2, as the quest is never placed in the Completed Quests section of the Journal.  The following eight quests are removed entirely from the Journal instead of becoming Completed Quests, and thus must satisfy condition 2:
- Invited to a Party
- The Jedi Council (for both completions)
- The Ebon Hawk
- Sunry's Story
- Elora, Sunry's Wife
- Gluupor, the Rodian
- Ignus, the Hotel Owner
- Firith Me, the Pazaak Player

The final quest is the last one in the game, "The Final Confrontation".  The game actually never bothers to update that quest at any point after giving it to you, so for the purposes of the speedrun it is considered to be complete when Malak is defeated (when the timer stops).

### Glitchless Ruleset

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

All glitches are banned, with the exception of the following:
- [Fast Text](<../Techniques/Glitchless Tricks#fast-text>)
- [Duration Glitch](<../Techniques/Glitchless Tricks#duration-glitch>)
- [Speed Extension](<../Techniques/Glitchless Tricks#speed-extension>)
- [Stunned Combat](<../Techniques/Glitchless Tricks#stunned-combat>)
- [Auto-Level Attributes](<../Techniques/Glitchless Tricks#auto-level-attributes>)

In addition, exploits that give infinite experience, credits, or alignment points are also banned.

Due to its glitchy nature, QUICKSAVE is banned as well.  Manual and autosaves, however, are allowed.

## Character Build

### Character Creation

Male Scout - Male and Female characters are roughly comparable timewise; Male is slightly faster, as the NPC for the Invited to a Party quest (Sarna) is closer to the cantina door than that for the female (Yun Genda).  In addition, as a Male the Carth quest completes as soon as you gain access to the Finding Dustil sidequest, whereas a female must talk to him several more times before his quest completes.  This guide will assume a Male character.

Scout is picked for automatic access to Flurry, Implant Level 2 and Computer Use as a Class Skill.

**Initial Attributes**
- 18 Str
- 12 Dex
- 12 Con
- 10 Int
- 8 Wis
- 12 Cha

**Initial Skills**
* Computer Use - 4
* Treat Injury - 4
* Save the rest

**Initial Feat** - Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons

The attribute spread maximizes damage while striking a balance between durability and utility.  18 Strength is to maximize our damage and hit rate with melee weapons.  The points in Dexterity and Constitution are to give us some survivability, particularly in the early-mid game.  The 10 Intelligence gives us enough skill points to bump Computer Use and Treat Injury to 8, while still saving enough points to max out Persuade when we become a Jedi.  The 12 Charisma combines with Empathy and Force Valor to guarantee all Persuade checks, even the hard ones.  Another option is to take 10 Cha and 14 Dex, but then there's only a 75% chance to pass hard Persuade checks, and there are at least two essential Persuades of this nature.

For skills, we will use Computer Use to help save on spikes throughout the run, Treat Injury to make our inevitable medpac use more effective, and Persuade to take some key conversational shortcuts.

### Leveling Plan

| Level | Feat | Power | Skills |
|---| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons, *Flurry* | | Com to 4, Stealth to 1, TI to 4, Save 2 |
| 2 | Two-Weapon Fighting | | Save All |
| 3 | Empathy | | Save All |
| 4 | *Implant 2, Uncanny Dodge* | | Save All |
| 5 | Improved Two-Weapon Fighting | | Save All |
| 6 | Improved Flurry, *Force Jump* | Burst of Speed, Force Valor | Save All |
| 7 | | Affect Mind | Per to 10, TI to 10 |
| 8 | Master Two-Weapon Fighting | Dominate Mind | Per to 11 |
| 9 | | Knight Speed | Per to 12 |
| 10 | | Knight Valor | Per to 13 |
| 11 | Master Flurry, *Improved Force Jump* | Force Resistance | Per to 14 |
| 12 | Weapon Focus: Lightsaber | Drain Life | Per to 15 |
| 13 | | Energy Resistance | Per to 16 |
| 14 | Weapon Specialization: Lightsaber | Improved Energy Resistance | Per to 17 |
| 15 | | Master Speed | Per to 18 |
| 16 | | Master Valor | Per to 19 |

Our main plan is to combine Master Speed with Master Flurry and a double-bladed lightsaber for five attacks per round in the late game.  Master Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus: Lightsaber, stims and lightsaber crystals give us enough attack that we can reliably hit even with the attack penalties.

- We take Empathy at level 3 to gain a small boost to Persuade and Treat Injury; no other feat is as useful at that level.
- Implant Level 2 is granted for free at Level 4, allowing us to equip the Nerve Enhancement Package.
- For the rest of our feats, we stack everything we can that improves our chance to hit; Master Flurry, Master Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus/Specialization: Lightsaber all go towards that goal.
- We reach level 5 on Taris so that we can be as strong as possible for the Duel Ring sidequest after rescuing Bastila; in particular, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting is very important for those duels.  
- Level 6 is saved for when we become a Jedi so we can take Speed, Valor, and Affect Mind before leaving Dantooine.
- Force Speed is the key to our combat build; Knight Speed, and later Master Speed, is critical to get as many attacks in as possible.
- Force Valor helps us out on pretty much every key fight, starting with Juhani and going all the way up to Darth Malak.  It also guarantees hard Persuade checks in a few key places.
- Force Resistance is used on Manaan, Korriban and the Star Forge to help protect against hostile Force Powers, particularly on Deck 2 of the Forge.
- Dominate Mind allows us to pass certain Persuade checks, particularly Lashowe on Korriban.  Affect Mind allows us to access Manaan, Tatooine and Kashyyyk without paying the docking fee, among other things.

For skills, the 10 points in Intelligence allow us to have 4 net Computer Use, saving 1 spike per hacking with our MC.  Treat Injury helps us preserve some medpacs by making them more effective. Persuade helps us shortcut some quests and bypass some fights, and we max this out as soon as we become a Jedi.  We keep putting points in Persuade because as we level, we need more Persuasion to continue to pass important Persuade checks, including Jagi and the Sandral-Matale feud. The point in Stealth is solely to get a Stealth Field Generator from the initial footlocker on Endar Spire, which we sell for 40 Credits.

## Equipment Plan

### Final Equipment

**Implant: Nerve Enhancement Package** - Bought on Taris, Zelka's Shop (500 Credits)
- A convenient source of Immunity: Mind-Affecting for those pesky Dark Jedi.

**Head: Breath Mask** - Bought on Dantooine, Crattis Yurkal's shop (100 Credits)
- This cheap hat gives Immunity: Poison, which is convenient mostly for defending against the related Force powers from Dark Jedi.

**Gloves: GenoHaradan Power Gloves** - Received on Manaan from Hulas
- The reward for killing Ithorak, +4 Strength is only bested by the Dominator Gauntlets, which cost way too much for the marginal upgrade.
  
**Body: Jedi Knight Robe** - Found on Dantooine, Nemo's corpse
- This robe we get while looting the Sigil crystal, and it's good enough to use for the entire run.  A Master Robe's +1 defense upgrade is not worth the time it would take to get one.
  
**Belt: CNS Strength Enhancer** - Bought on Dantooine, Crattis Yurkal's shop (8500 Credits)
- A belt that gives +2 Strength and +2 to all saving throws helps on both offense and defense, and is worth the exoribtant price we pay.  All of our Manaan Swoop Race winnings go into this belt.

**Weapon: Double-bladed Lightsaber** - Found on Taris, Brejik's corpse
- We borrow Bastila's lightsaber for the bulk of the game.  This allows us to use Force Jump, as well as maximize the effects of the Sigil, Solari and Krayt Dragon Pearl crystals that we place into it.  It's also free, which reduces the strain on the credit route quite a bit compared to the alternatives.

### Other Equipment

**Gloves: Strength Gauntlets** - Found on Taris, Sith Governor's corpse
- Until we have the Power Gloves, we make do with the free Strength Gauntlets from the forced loot of the Governor's corpse.

**Body: Combat Suit** - Found on Endar Spire, footlocker
- On Taris, we use the Combat Suit to help us tank damage as we run past endless Black Vulkars, Rakghouls, and Gamorreans.

**Weapon: Prototype Vibroblade** - Found on Endar Spire, Sith Commander's corpse
- On Taris, we use the Prototype Vibroblade in our mainhand and either a standard Vibroblade or Mission's Vibroblade in the offhand.  The Prototype gets upgraded with an Energy Projector for +2 attack before the Duel Ring.

## Credit Route

The only major purchases made during the run are the CNS Strength Enhancer, HK-47, and a large amount of utility items, including stims and medpacs for fights, and computer spikes and parts for hacking.  Because of this, the credit route is generally lenient, except for the very beginning on Taris and the very end on Korriban.

These are the shopping trips we make during the run; notice we sell items as few times as possible.

**1. Larrim on Taris**
- *Sell*: Unneeded Items to reach around 1440-1540 Credits
- *Buy:* 2x Concussion Grenade and Battle Stimulant (~1150 or ~1250 Credits left)

**2. Zelka Forn on Taris**
- *Buy*: Nerve Enhancement Package, 10x Adrenal Alacrity, 3-5x Adrenal Strength (<50 Credits left)

**3. Janice Nall on Taris**
- *Buy*: 2x Computer Spike
- *Sell*: Unneeded Items to reach around 6269 Credits

**4. Mic'Tunan'Jus Orgu on Tatooine**
- *Buy*: 4x Life Support Pack, 9-10x Advanced Medpac, 0-1x Adrenal Strength, Bantha Fodder (~7818 Credits left)
- *Sell*: Unneeded Items to reach around 11023 Credits

**5. Selkath Merchant on Manaan**
- *Buy*: 8x Computer Spike, 7x Parts, 5x All Hyper Stims (~1703 Credits left)

**6. Crattis Yurkal on Dantooine**
- *Buy*: CNS Strength Enhancer, Breath Mask, +/-3, +/-5 Pazaak Cards (~103 Credits left)

**7. Junix Nard on Tatooine**
- *Buy*: 1x +/-1, 2x +/-2, 2x +/-3, 2x +/-4 Pazaak Cards (~1003 Credits left)

**8. Czerka Store on Korriban**
- *Buy*: 5x Echani Battle Stim, 5x Each of Hyper Alacrity, Strength, and Stamina (~1 Credit Left) 

Notice that we sell as much as possible to Janice Nall on Taris; shops on Taris give 40% of item value for sell prices, compared to 25% off of Taris, so we maximize our credits that way.  

In addition to selling items, other major sources of credits include:
- Duel Ring rewards
- Taris Bounty and Rakghoul Serum rewards
- Manaan Swoop Races
- Other Quest Rewards

## Alignment Route

Alignment in KotOR is a sliding scale from 0 to 100, initialized at 50; higher numbers are Light, lower numbers are dark. Shifts in alignment are determined by a matrix; every alignment-shifting action is classified as Light or Dark, and then assigned a level (either Low, Mid, or High). The player character can be aligned as Very Dark, Dark, Neutral, Light, or Very Light. The more opposed your alignment and the action's classification, the more drastic your shift in alignment; for example, a Light-aligned character performing a High Dark action will have a large shift, while a Dark character performing a High Dark action will have a smaller shift. 

### Alignment Shifts

Here's the full list of alignment shifts that happen during the run; there are 46 total shifts, of which 27 are dark and 19 are light:

| Aligned | Action | Type | Delta | New |
|---| :--- | :--- |---|---|
| Neutral | Game Start | -- | 50 | 50 |

| Neutral | Threaten Janice Nall for T3 | Low Dark | -4 | 42 |
| Neutral | Sell the Rakghoul Serum to Zax | Low Dark | -2 | 40 |
| Neutral | Threaten Yuka Laka for HK-47 | Low Dark | -2 | 38 |

| Neutral | Kill Rulan | Low Dark | -2 | 43 |
| Neutral | Kill Freyyr | High Dark | -6 | 37 |
| Dark | | Low Dark | -1 | 36 |
| Dark | Kashyyyk Star Map Quiz | Low Light | +4 | 40 |
| Dark | | Low Dark | -2 | 38 |
| Dark | Report Freyyr's death to Chuundar | High Dark | -4 | 34 |
| Dark | Tell Matton not to kill Eli | High Light | +8 | 42 |
| Neutral | Buy Sharina's wraid plate for half price | Low Dark | -2 | 40 |
| Neutral | Kill Vorn | Low Dark | -2 | 38 |
| Dark | Order Sasha off your ship | Mid Dark | -2 | 36 |
| Dark | Kill Ithorak | Low Dark | -1 | 35 |
| Dark | Threaten Shasa | High Dark | -4 | 31 |
| Dark | Prevent Carth from killing Saul | Low Light | +4 | 35 |
| Dark | Tell Shaardan not to kill the hopefuls | Low Light | +4 | 39 |
| Dark | Persuade Yuthura to admit you to the Sith Academy | Low Dark | -1 | 38 |
| Dark | Persuade Kel Algwinn to return to the Jedi | Hardcoded | +3 | 41 |
| Neutral | Give Dustil evidence of Uthar's betrayal | High Light | +6 | 47 |

| Neutral | | Highest Light | +10 | 69 |
| Light | Tell Malak that you serve the light | Low Light | +1 | 70 |

If you're more of a visual learner, you can see the overall alignment in chart form here:

![A line chart showing overall alignment throughout the run](/assets/images/imgur-dump/1M41pKo.png)

The alignment route is quite lenient, since we no longer try to equip the Solari crystal until after Lehon, when we get a massive infusion of light side points when we choose to renounce our former identity.

Some other fun facts for the alignment route:
- The lowest alignment is 31, after attacking Shasa on Manaan; the highest is 70, at the very end.
- Of the 47 alignment shifts, 8 are high shifts, 7 are mid shifts, and 29 are low shifts.  3 are specially coded to be a specific amount regardless of your alignment.
- Before the Leviathan, there are only 8 light side shifts against 24 dark shifts; after Leviathan there are 11 light vs. only 4 dark.
- When you fly to Lehon, your alignment is 51, almost exactly where it started.
- Staying true to the light side is the first time the route is light-aligned; in fact, it's the first time the alignment goes above 51.

The ending for the run is the light side ending; see below.

### Quest Alignment Choices

In general, every quest outcome is chosen to get the fastest time, regardless of alignment.  Some notes on some non-intuitive choices:

**1. Dia's Bounty - Dark**
  - We kill Dia on Taris because it's faster than Persuading Holdan to drop the bounty, since you'd have to talk to Zax twice in that case, then Transit Back and talk to Dia.

**2. The Promised Land - Light**
  - Giving Rukil the Promised Land journals is faster because you must give him the apprentice's journal, and you can turn in the other journals in the same conversation.  We also don't need Igear's pitiful credit reward.

**3. Rakghoul Serum - Dark**
  - Selling the Rakghoul Serum to Zax is faster than visiting Zelka a second time or delaying his shopping trip, since we have to talk to Zax anyway for the bounty quests.

**4. Tanis Trapped - Dark**
  - Killing Tanis is faster than solving the droid puzzles to save him.

**5. A Desert Hunt - Dark**
  - We kill Komad for a second Krayt Pearl, as this allows us to use one in our lightsaber and the second for the quest Worthy of History.  Killing him before the bantha escort saves time, as we then don't have to talk to him after the escort.

**6. Manaan Swoop Races - Light**
  - Loaning Queedle money before doing the Manaan Swoop Races saves time because otherwise you're forced to talk to Huxta Jax between the second and third swoop races.

**7. Mission for the Republic - Neutral**
  - We save the Progenitor on Manaan because killing her locks us out of both the Republic Hiring Mercenaries and the Missing Selkath sidequests; it is also just a little slower than killing her.

**8. Star Map: Kashyyyk - Dark** 
  - We give the "correct" answers during the Star Map quiz on Kashyyyk because it's faster than giving Light Side answers and having to fight the Defense Droids.  The answers we give actually give us a Low Dark, then a Low Light, then a Low Dark action, which evens out to a single -2 Dark Side Points.

**9. A Chieftain in Need - Dark**
  - We now kill Freyyr in the Shadowlands, because siding with Freyyr would prevent us from meeting Jagi as we leave Kashyyyk.  Killing him in the Shadowlands allows us to skip the Ritual Beast and the fight with Chuundar in the Chieftain's Hall as well.  Finally, this also completes the A Wookiee Lost sidequest as soon as we are locked out of the Wookiee Village.

**10. Honest Debt - Light**
  - Since we now side with Chuundar, we have to complete the Honest Debt sidequest directly.  We choose to prevent Matton from killing Eli because the time difference is negligible, and going Dark here is actually a fairly large swing that could jeopardize our later alignment.

**11. Middleman - Dark**
  - We give Sharina half-price for her wraid plate, as it's cheaper, very slightly faster, and we don't need the light side points anymore.

**12. Missing Selkath - Dark**
  - Threatening and attacking Shasa is a few seconds faster than Persuading her to leave, and in the long term, the dark alignment shift doesn't affect anything.

**13. Korriban Sidequests and Prestige** 
  - Many of the Korriban choices are made because we can only turn in five prestige points before Uthar stops accepting other quests.  Choosing the Dark Mandalorian Weapons Cache, Light Doubting Sith, Neutral Ajunta Pall's Sword, and Light Renegade Sith allows those sidequests to be completed without talking to Uthar; this leaves only five quests (Code of the Sith, Hermit in the Hills, Rogue Droid, Aiding Lashowe, and Double-Double Cross) that require getting a prestige point from Uthar.  The only other reasonable possibility is Neutral Renegade Sith and Light Rogue Droid; this is slower on average by 2-3s. 

**14. Finding Dustil - Light** 
  - Choosing to give Dustil the evidence of Uthar's treachery is just barely slower, but prevents having to fight him and also prevents a large alignment swing that could affect our ability to equip Solari.

**15. The Sword of Ajunta Pall - Neutral**
  - Since we are no longer light-aligned when we do this quest, we now opt for the neutral ending of just saying goodbye after finding his sword.

**16. Hermit in the Hills - Dark** 
  - Choosing the Dark Hermit in the Hills completion is faster and prevents having to fight Jorak Uln, who's actually kind of a pain.

**17. Trapped on a Nameless World - Light**
  - We stay true to the Light Side on Lehon because otherwise the "Juhani" quest does not complete.  It's also faster, since we would otherwise have to bring Bastila through the Star Forge with us.

## Route Overview

### Planet Route

Taris -> Dantooine 1 -> Tatooine 1 -> Manaan 1 -> Dantooine 2 -> Kashyyyk -> Tatooine 2 -> Manaan 2 -> Leviathan -> Korriban -> Unknown Planet -> Star Forge

Some planets require at least two visits, such as:
- Manaan: You must visit to trigger the GenoHaradan quests, then leave to kill the targets, then return to finish them.
- Dantooine: The Zuulan bounty for the GenoHaradan is here, and can only be done on a second visit.
- Tatooine: While Tatooine can be done in a single visit, that requires two visits to Korriban; thus, we do Tatooine in two visits.  We no longer need a third visit to Tatooine, since we can finish the GenoHaradan quest with Hulas on Manaan, and Jagi can be triggered to show up before the Leviathan by talking to Canderous enough.

Planets that can be done in a single visit include:
- Korriban: Korriban does not require two visits if you get its Star Map last, since then you can do the Premium Merchant quest at that time.  The Premium Merchant quest is only available after the Leviathan.
- Kashyyyk: Kashyyyk can be done in one visit, as long as you visit Manaan first to trigger the GenoHaradan bounty for Rulan.

This route does not visit Yavin space station, as there are no official quests there.  While we don't get the Baragwin Assault Blade or the Advanced Bio-Stabilizer Mask, we save time by not having to visit Suvam twice.

### Vulkar Base
- Turn right and head to end of hallway
- Defense Turret Skip:
  - Open door to elevator area
  - Stand in doorframe corner near terminal and make a manual save
  - If you've loaded saves an *even number of times* (including 0), load the manual save to (hopefully) avoid having to make an extra save later
  - Loading a save here will also likely duration glitch your Alacrity, allowing you to avoid using more until the Duel Ring
  - Pause the game, then queue two concussion grenades on the center turret
  - Unpause; if any turret remains active after both grenades, load the safety save and try again
  - If all three turrets are stunned, take the elevator to the Garage
  - There is a 59.6% chance to stun all three with two grenades. Good luck!

- Possible save and load before exiting the garage
  - If you have loaded saves an even number of times total prior to this, you'll need to save and load or the turrets will instantly kill you on the way out
  - If you have loaded saves an odd number of times, you should be safe to skip this; you can choose to safety save anyway to be sure
  - If you get both Rancor Juke and Turret Skip without having to reload, and do the recommended reload above, you won't have to save here
- Take first door on right, first door on right, and head back left to exit Vulkar Base 

### Rescuing Bastila
- Return to Hidden Bek base and talk to Gadon Thek
  - Try to avoid using a medpac here as you're full healed at the Swoop Platform
- Successfully win the swoop races
  - Talk to the Race Coordinator before each one
  - Whatever time you get on the first race will be beaten by 0.25s by Redros
  - You'll need to beat Redros's time on the second race, but your swoop accelerates faster
- Kill Brejik using grenades
  - Throw a Poison Grenade first, then Sonic, then Frag
  - He has really high defense, so grenades are the best option
  - The Poison Grenade is guaranteed to hit, and will kill him fairly quickly even if he saves one of the other two grenades
  - The Sonic and Frag grenades will do 10 or 20 damage
    - If both do 20, he dies immediately
    - If one does 20, he'll die from poison soon after
    - If both do 10, the poison will still kill him but it will take 6 seconds longer
- Loot Brejik's corpse and talk to Bastila
  - This takes you back to the apartment hideout

## Taris 2

### Hideout
- Carth and Bastila accost you: 1,1,1 ... 2
  - ***Finishes "The Search for Bastila"***
  - ***Starts "Escaping Taris"***
- Workbench: Upgrade Prototype Vibroblade with Energy Projector
- Bastila #1 and Carth #3
  - The Bastila conversation can be skipped, but then she'll try to talk to you while you're moving later, so it's best to mash through it quickly here
  - ***Starts "Bastila"***
- `Level to 5: Save all Skills, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting`
- Carth #4
- Exit the Hideout
  - *Party: Add Bastila when prompted*
- Twi'lek accosts you
- *Equip Bastila: Two Vibroblades*
- 'Level Bastila to 4: Cha to 16, Save Skills, Burst of Speed'
  - Setting Charisma to 16 gives her just enough FP to cast Speed twice  
- In Options -> Gameplay, activate the Auto-Level option for party members; this makes them easier to keep alive when they're active in your party later
- Use Bastila's Burst of Speed to enter the Upper City Cantina
  - Be careful that the MC follows you and doesn't get stuck; try to keep a clear path between him and Bastila until he speeds up his pace
- Inside the cantina, Canderous accosts you
  - ***Starts "Purchasing a Droid"***

### The Duel Ring
- After the Duel Ring CS, talk to Ajuur with MC
  - Starts ***"The Duel Ring"***
- Then alternate who you talk to Ajuur with each time; Bastila after Duncan, MC after Gerlon, etc.
- You'll have to talk to Ajuur twice between each duel, the second time always as MC
- *Stims: Strength on MC in the arena before Ice, Marl, and Twitch*
  - ***Optional:*** If you bought extra stims from Zelka, *Stims: Strength on MC before Gerlon also*
  - ***Optional but Recommended:*** Use a Concussion Grenade against Twitch at the start; if the 45% stun works, his fight is consistently 2-3 rounds, whereas without it's usually 6-7 rounds (or worse)
- Try to bump your enemies as well; this can cancel or delay their attacks
- *DO NOT* speak to Ajuur after defeating Twitch
- Use Bastila's Burst of Speed to speak to Bendak to setup his fight
- Leave and reenter Upper City Cantina
  - This is needed to trigger the Bendak fight
- Talk to Ajuur with Bastila
- Kill Bendak
  - *Stims: Alacrity, Strength, Stamina, Battle Stim on MC*
  - Bumping Bendak is key here; this keeps his blaster equipped for longer, giving you a +10 attack bonus for Melee vs. Ranged.  
  - If you can keep his blaster equipped long enough, Bendak can die in 4 rounds; once he draws his sword, it's much tougher to hit him.
  - ***Finishes "The Duel Ring"***
  - ***Starts "Bendak's Bounty"***
- Talk to Ajuur twice with MC: 2,2,2 ... none
  - This replaces Twitch's reward with an extra copy of Bendak's
- Swap to Bastila
- Cast Burst of Speed and exit to the Upper City

### Sith Base
- Secretary accosts you: 3,1

  - Kill the patrol droid in the right hallway

- Assault Droid fight:
  - Bastila: Use Concussion Grenade, then Flurry Assault Droid
  - MC: Flurry Assault Droid (the NEP protects you from the Concussion Grenade)
  - T3: Shield Disruptor x2 on each blaster turret
  - If you got a random Concussion grenade drop or didn't use the one on Twitch, have T3 use one on the droid as well
  - With one Concussion, it's a 55% chance to stun; with two it's 79.75%
  - The fight is pretty clean with a stun and a slog without it.  Good luck!
- Enter the elevator
- Sith Governor fight:
  - MC: Sonic Grenade, then Flurry
  - Bastila: Stun x2 (Force Power), then Flurry
  - T3: Stun Ray x4
  - T3's Stun Ray has a 25% chance to stun the governor each time
  - Bastila's Stun has only a 15% chance, but it lowers his Defense by 4 each time he saves; when stunned, his defense is lowered by 8 total.
    - These stack, so if he gets stunned MC should have no problem finishing him off.
- Loot both strongboxes and Sith Governor's corpse for Launch Codes (+3; 8 Spikes)
- Exit the Sith Base with Bastila's Burst of Speed
  - Be careful that MC and T3 follow you here

  - MC/Canderous: Frag Grenades (2 for MC, 1 for Canderous)
