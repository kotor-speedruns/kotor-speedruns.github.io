# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - All Star Maps Guide

### v2.0: Male/Female Scoundrel Route

*Route and Guide by [indykenobi](https://www.speedrun.com/users/indykenobi)*

This route defeats Malak on the Star Forge as fast as possible while obtaining all five individual Star Maps.  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black at the start of the Malak Death cutscene. A load-removal tool and auto-splitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to [glasnonck](https://www.speedrun.com/users/glasnonck) and [XeroHR](https://www.speedrun.com/users/XeroHR) (results may vary for Windows 11 users); times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent. This guide will cover the character build and detailed route for the run.

Finally, if you have additional questions, you can check out the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu). There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

## Category Definition

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

All Star Maps (ASM) requires each Star Map object to be opened individually on each planet: Dantooine, Korriban, Tatooine, Manaan, and Kashyyyk.  You do *not* have to obtain the Star Map quest items.  ASM uses the Unrestricted ruleset only; currently, neither the NMG nor Glitchless rulesets can skip a Star Map normally, so for those rulesets there would be no difference between Any% and ASM.

Thus any glitches are allowed, including the Routine.  However, all KotOR speedruns ban the following:

- Abusing the windowed nature of the game to teleport a character (including Super Save Teleports)
- Severe underclocking of one’s monitor to increase Save Teleport distance
- Abusing the load removal to excessively pause the timer
- Loading saves created prior to the run
- Use of mods or other external tools to modify the software in any way

## Route Overview

This route skips Jedi training on Dantooine, instead using [Coordinate Warps](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) and [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to move quickly.  The run should begin with *no save files*; eventually we will use six total save slots.

### Choosing a Disguise

This run requires one of two disguises in order to unequip the Envirosuit for the underwater sections of Manaan.  You have a choice of whether to obtain the Sith Armor from the North Apartments on Taris, or the Sand People Outfit from an Elite Warrior on Tatooine.  The differences are as follows:

**Sand People Outfit:**
- Ideally 7 seconds faster
- Requires [Lower City DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#lower-city-dlz>)
- See a Sand Person underwater

**Sith Armor:**
- Skips the Lower City DLZ
- While possibly 7 seconds slower, the volatilty of DLZs means you may not lose any time
- Don't see a Sand Person underwater

You'll need to decide ahead of time which outfit to obtain, as the first route difference based on this choice is less than 2 minutes into the run.  If you feel confident in your ability to get the [Lower City DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#lower-city-dlz>) within 5 seconds, consider the Sand People Outfit; otherwise (or if you just want one less [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#lower-city-dlz>) to worry about), go for the Sith Armor.

The [detailed route](#detailed-route) will have notes in certain places detailing differences in actions based on what disguise you choose to get.  These will be denoted by ***Sith Armor Only:*** or ***Sand People Outfit Only:***, as appropriate.

## Character Build

We begin as a Scoundrel; this guide as written can be completed as either a Male or Female character, with no time difference.  Scoundrel is picked for its access to Sneak Attack IX, which is abused to quickly kill the Sith Governor and Gadon Thek.

### Character Creation

**Initial Attributes:**
* Str - 8
* Dex - 18
* Con - 14
* Int - 8
* Wis - 14
* Cha - 10

**Initial Skills:**
* Awareness - 4
* Persuade - 4
* Security - 4

**Initial Feat:** - Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols -or- Two-Weapon Fighting (*see below*)

### Leveling Plan

*Level 2: [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>) to obtain:*
- Improved or Master Two-Weapon Fighting
- Sneak Attack IX 

There are two feat builds to take; the fastest build is to take Two-Weapon Fighting at character creation and use the fastest form of [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>) to get Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Sneak Attack IX.  The downside to this is weaker chances to hit on our three fights, so if you prefer to improve your odds by 15% per attack, you can instead take Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols at character creation and do the slower (All Quests) version of the [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>).

We end the run at level 2 due to all the [Hotshots](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) we do, so this is the only choice to make regarding character build.

**Character Build Notes:**

- *Attributes:* Max Dexterity aids our chance to hit with blaster pistols for our three fights.  We choose pistols over melee weapons to abuse the +10 Ranged vs. Melee bonus, especially since two of our fights are done via Wire Targeting.  Con and Wis are used for saving throws against stunning powers.  10 Charisma is required for some Persuade checks on Kashyyyk.
- *Skills:* Persuade is used in a few places, namely to Persuade Yuthura, Lashowe, and the Manaan scientists in Kolto Control.  Security is only necessary for a skip on Endar Spire that allows us to skip Trask.  Points in Awareness allow us to see some mines to avoid them, but they're not really necessary.
- *Feats:* Improved/Master Two-Weapon Fighting and Sneak Attack IX allow us to take out Gadon and the Sith Governor in short-order.  Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols can help our chance to hit slightly if that build is chosen.  We use Sniper Shot as our main combat feat because it's the default combat feat for Scoundrels.

## Endar Spire

*Before beginning, disable VSync in Advanced Graphics Options if you are using the Rubble [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) on Endar Spire.  This makes the [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) more consistent.*

### Character Creation

- Male/Female Scoundrel - Custom Character
- Dex to 18, Con to 14, Wis to 14, Cha to 10

  - ***Method One: Rubble [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>)***
    - *This strat is potentially 20 seconds faster, but the [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) is marginally harder.  This is the recommended method.*
    - *To perform this strat:*
      - Skip the footlocker and talking to Trask
      - [Open Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#open-buffers>) past Trask to use Security during Trask's first conversation
      - [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) by walking into the rubble near the second Sith soldier in the right spot
  - ***Method Two: Doorframe [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone)***
    - *This strat is much more consistent, but significantly slower than a good Rubble [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>).  It's recommended only for beginning runners.*
    - *To perform this strat:*
      - Loot footlocker
      - *Equip MC: Clothes*
      - Open door and Talk to Trask twice
      - [Open Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#open-buffers>) to use Security during the Carth CS
      - Kill first two Sith and open next door
      - [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) by walking into the right side of the door frame in the right spot

### Starboard Section

- [QS Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#quick-save-hotshots>) back to the Command Module to activate Plot Armor:
  - Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the load screen after the prior [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>)
  - After Carth's convo starts, [access the Options Menu](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch#accessing-menus>) to **Hard Save in New Slot (Slot 1)**

## Closing

If you made it this far, congratulations! Thanks for reading the guide. Please let indykenobi know if you have any comments or questions (best way to contact is on Discord).

I'd like to acknowledge glasnonck and thinkshooter, whose runs got me into KotOR speedrunning, as well as glasnonck, Lane, HotShotWire and the rest of the KotOR community for tossing around ideas and breaking this game so much that we can have an All Star Maps category that's different from Any%!

Extra shoutout to glasnonck for his Walkmesh Visualizer tool, which made plotting out the coordinate warps in the midgame possible without going insane.
