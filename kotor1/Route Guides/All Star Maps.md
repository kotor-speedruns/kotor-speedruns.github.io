# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - All Star Maps Guide

### v3.0: Male/Female Scoundrel Route

*Route and Guide by [indykenobi](https://www.speedrun.com/users/indykenobi)*

This route defeats Malak on the Star Forge as fast as possible while obtaining all five individual Star Maps.  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black at the start of the Malak Death cutscene. A load-removal tool and auto-splitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to [glasnonck](https://www.speedrun.com/users/glasnonck) and [XeroHR](https://www.speedrun.com/users/XeroHR) (results may vary for Windows 11 users); times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent. This guide will cover the character build and detailed route for the run.

Finally, if you have additional questions, you can check out the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu). There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

## Category Definition

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

All Star Maps (ASM) requires each Star Map object to be opened individually on each planet: Dantooine, Korriban, Tatooine, Manaan, and Kashyyyk.  You do *not* have to obtain the Star Map quest items.  ASM uses the Unrestricted ruleset only; currently, neither the NMG nor Glitchless rulesets can skip a Star Map normally, so for those rulesets there would be no difference between Any% and ASM.

Thus any glitches are allowed, including the Routine.  However, all KotOR speedruns ban the following:

- Abusing the windowed nature of the game to teleport a character (including Super Save Teleports)
- Severe underclocking of oneâ€™s monitor to increase Save Teleport distance
- Abusing the load removal to excessively pause the timer
- Loading saves created prior to the run
- Use of mods or other external tools to modify the software in any way

## Route Overview

This route skips Jedi training on Dantooine, instead using [Coordinate Warps](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) and [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to move quickly.  The run should begin with *no save files*; eventually we will use five total save slots.

A brief outline of the route for the ASM run, including planet order and major skips:

*1. Endar Spire*

* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) into the Starboard Section
* Reach Taris

*2. Taris*

* Perform [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>) to get Sneak Attack IX and Improved/Master Two-Weapon Fighting
* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#sith-base-dlz>) into the Sith Base
* Kill and loot the Sith Governor to obtain Taris Launch Codes

* [Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) to Vulkar Base and use [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) to skip one swoop race
* [Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) to Javyar's Cantina and recruit Canderous
* Use [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) to steal the Ebon Hawk and escape Taris

*3. Dantooine*

* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#enclave-dlz>) to the Courtyard
* [Door Clip](<../Major Glitches/Door Clipping>) past the Ruins door and [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#ruins-entry-dlz>) into the Ruins
* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#ruins-star-map-dlz>) to get the Star Map

*4. Midgame Setup*

* Reach the Valley of the Dark Lords
* Reach the Upper Shadowlands
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Bastila to Valley of the Dark Lords
* Enter the Tomb of Naga Sadow
* Reach West Central
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Bastila to Upper Shadowlands
* Reach Lower Shadowlands
* [Autosave Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#autosave-hotshots>) to West Central
* Reach East Central

*5. Map Collection*

* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to get the Kashyyyk Star Map
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to reach Hrakert Station
* Get the Hunting License from the Czerka Office in Anchorhead
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to get the Korriban Star Map
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to get the Envirosuit and reach Sea Floor
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee from a STUNT module to the Sea Floor to skip the disguise
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to Anchorhead to reach the Dune Sea
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to Kolto Control to reach Hrakert Rift
* [Autosave Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#autosave-hotshots>) to Hrakert Rift to get the Manaan Star Map
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to Dune Sea via Upper Shadowlands to reach Eastern Dune Sea
* Krayt Dragon Skip to get the Tatooine Star Map

*6. Lehon*

* Use Fighter Skirmish skip to spawn on Lehon
* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#temple-entry-dlz>) to enter the Ancient Temple
* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#temple-summit-dlz>) to reach the summit
* Use [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) to skip the Bastila fight and fall to the Dark Side
* Use a [Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) to skip repairing the Ebon Hawk 
* Fly to the Star Forge

*7. Star Forge*

* [GP Warp](<../Techniques/GP Warp>) and [Double Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) to skip Deck 1
* [GP Warp](<../Techniques/GP Warp>) and [Double Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) to skip the Star Forge Computer
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Bastila to Viewing Platform
* Kill Darth Malak with Thermal Detonators and an [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>)

This route used to obtain either Sith Armor or the Sand People Outfit so a [Fast Lane](<../Major Glitches/Fast Lane>) could be used to remove the Envirosuit.  These can now be skipped thanks to the STUNT module [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) to Sea Floor and the [Autosave Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#autosave-hotshots>) to Hrakert Rift.  Those two warps, along with the [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) to the Envirosuit, also enable Plot Armor Skip (if desired), since these are the only points that would have a high risk of death (other than the Taris Sith Base).

## Character Build

We begin as a Scoundrel; this guide as written can be completed as either a Male or Female character, with no time difference.  Scoundrel is picked for its access to Sneak Attack IX, which is abused to quickly kill the Sith Governor and Gadon Thek.

### Character Creation

**Initial Attributes:**
* Str - 8
* Dex - 16/18
* Con - 18/16
* Int - 8
* Wis - 10
* Cha - 10

**Initial Skills:**
* Awareness - 4
* Persuade - 4
* Security - 4

**Initial Feat:** - Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols -or- Two-Weapon Fighting (*see below*)

### Leveling Plan

*Level 2: [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>) to obtain:*
- Improved or Master Two-Weapon Fighting
- Sneak Attack IX 

There are two feat builds to take; the fastest build is to take Two-Weapon Fighting at character creation and use the fastest form of [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>) to get Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Sneak Attack IX.  The downside to this is weaker chances to hit on our three fights, so if you prefer to improve your odds by 15% per attack, you can instead take Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols at character creation and do the slower (All Quests) version of the [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>).

We end the run at level 2 due to all the [Hotshots](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) we do, so this is the only choice to make regarding character build.

**Character Build Notes:**

- *Attributes:* Dexterity aids our chance to hit with blaster pistols for our two fights, while Constitution gives us a higher chance to survive in the Taris Sith Base.  It's personal preference whether to choose 18 Dex (for maximum chance to hit the Governor and Gadon) or 18 Con (for maximum Vitality).  We choose pistols over melee weapons to abuse the +10 Ranged vs. Melee bonus, especially since one of our two fights is done via Wire Targeting.  10 Wisdom is used for saving throws against stunning powers, while 10 Charisma is required for some Persuade checks on Kashyyyk.
- *Skills:* Persuade is used to Persuade Yuthura and Lashowe on Korriban.  Security is only necessary for a skip on Endar Spire that allows us to skip Trask.  Points in Awareness allow us to see some mines to avoid them, but they're not really necessary.
- *Feats:* Improved/Master Two-Weapon Fighting and Sneak Attack IX allow us to take out Gadon and the Sith Governor in short-order.  Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols can help our chance to hit slightly if that build is chosen.  We use Sniper Shot as our main combat feat because it's the default combat feat for Scoundrels.

## Endar Spire

*Before beginning, disable VSync in Advanced Graphics Options if you are using the Rubble [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) on Endar Spire.  This makes the [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) more consistent.*

### Character Creation

- Male/Female Scoundrel - Custom Character
- Dex to 16/18, Con to 18/16, Wis to 10, Cha to 10
- Awareness to 4, Persuade to 4, Security to 4
- Initial Feat: Two-Weapon Fighting *or* Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols
- Pick a good name!
- Hit Play! (and be ready to [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>)!)

### Command Module

- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip the intro CS
- [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) into the Starboard Section through one of the following two methods:
  - ***Method One: Rubble [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>)***
    - *This strat is potentially 20 seconds faster, but the [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) is marginally harder.  This is the recommended method.*
    - *To perform this strat:*
      - Skip the footlocker and talking to Trask
      - [Open Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#open-buffers>) past Trask to use Security during Trask's first conversation
      - [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) by walking into the rubble near the second Sith soldier in the right spot
  - ***Method Two: Doorframe [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone>)***
    - *This strat is much more consistent, but significantly slower than a good Rubble [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>).  It's recommended only for beginning runners.*
    - *To perform this strat:*
      - Loot footlocker
      - *Equip MC: Clothes*
      - Open door and Talk to Trask twice
      - [Open Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#open-buffers>) to use Security during the Carth CS
      - Kill first two Sith and open next door
      - [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) by walking into the right side of the door frame in the right spot

### Starboard Section

- Activate [AMG](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch) on the load screen for the Starboard Section

  - QS next to the footlocker to end the CS
- Loot footlocker in Terminal Room 
- Hack terminal console: 2,3 
- Carth accosts you
- Take escape pod to Taris 
  
## Taris

### Apartments

- Carth accosts you: 1,1,1,5,3
- Re-enable V-Sync in Options
- Exit the apartment
  - *Party: Keep Carth when prompted*
- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip the Sith Raid
- Perform the [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>)
  - See the discussion in [Character Build](#leveling-plan) for whether to include slow levels or not
  - Real Level 17: Persuade to 10, Improved/Master Two-Weapon Fighting, Sneak Attack IX
- Use a [Menu Item Duplication](<../Techniques/Item Duplication#menu-duping>) to dupe Carth's Blaster to MC
  - This also moves the Blaster Pistol in Carth's offhand to MC's offhand
- **Hard Save in New Slot (Slot 1)**
- Larrim accosts you: 1,2,4

```

```

- *Equip MC: Heavy Combat Suit*
- Exit to Upper City South

### Upper City South

- ***Optional Strat: Default Spawn Warp***
  - *This strat uses [The Routine](<../Major Glitches/The Routine>) to warp to the default spawn in Upper City South, just outside Zelka's clinic.  It's a very complicated glitch that saves only 2-3 seconds, so it's only recommended for top runners.*
  - *To perform this strat:*
    - Return to the Hideout
    - Perform [The Routine](<../Major Glitches/The Routine>) to delete Upper City South and the Hideout from your save file

    - Run to the left down the street until you are close to the sculpture
- ***Optional Strat: Upper City North DLZ***
  - *This strat reaches Upper City North with a DLZ instead of using a GP Warp.  It should only be used if you did the Default Spawn Warp above, and only saves a few seconds.*
  - *To use this strat:*
    - Talk to Zelka: 5
    - `SHOPPING: Zelka Forn`

    - Swap to Carth and [GP Warp](<../Techniques/GP Warp>) to warp MC
- Enter Upper City North

### Upper City North

- Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the Upper City North load screen
- [Autosave Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#autosave-hotshots>) to warp to elevator:
  - With quit dialog up, unpause and open the door to Upper City South behind you
  - Open the Options menu, then press enter with Load Game and Cancel selected
  - Unpause and navigate blindly through the door to Upper City South
  - After loading into Upper City South, select the Autosave and load it
  - This spawns your party next to the elevator leading to the Lower City
- **Hard Save in New Slot (Slot 2)**
- *Party: Remove Carth*
- [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#sith-base-dlz>) to enter the Sith Base
  - You should use Location 1 and deactivate V-Sync for this [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#sith-base-dlz>)

### Sith Base

- Secretary accosts you: 2,1
  - This can be optionally [Hard Buffered](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) instead
- ***Optional:*** Re-enable V-Sync in Options
  - Doing this now makes the Governor's conversation go faster, but this can be skipped to save the menuing time
- Run through Sith base to East Barracks
  - This is the spot in the run where you are most likely to die, so hope for good luck!
- Loot footlocker for Sith passcard
- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip assault droid CS
- Enter Governor's Office
  - Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the load
- [Wired Targeting](<../Techniques/Wired Targeting#quick-wired-targeting-combat>) to kill Governor
  - Open door, then buffer until you stand behind the Governor
  - Make sure you QS while standing next to him
  - Spam the conversation, then spam default attacks
    - If you didn't disable V-Sync, it can speed up the convo to click on and off of the game window
  - QL while spamming default attacks to attack the non-hostile governor
- Loot the Governor for the Taris Launch Codes
- *Unequip MC: Remove Both Blasters*
  - This will dupe the blasters when you [Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>)
- Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) via QS if it isn't already active
  - If you have V-Sync disabled, you'll probably have to QS/QL and activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the QL
- [Neo Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#neo-hotshots>) to Upper City North using Slot 2
- Enter the Lower City performing the [Lower City DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#lower-city-dlz>)

### Lower City

- Return to Hideout and immediately Transit Back to set Transit Point
  - *Party: Add Carth* while you do this
- *Stims: Alacrity on Carth* if it isn't already active
- Activate Solo Mode
- Use a [Conversation Queue](<../Techniques/Conversation Queue>) to skip the Gang War CS:
  - Run Carth along the right wall until just before it ends (where the CS triggers)
  - Swap to MC and talk to Carth, then immediately swap to Carth and turn right to the end of the hall
  - The [Conversation Queue](<../Techniques/Conversation Queue>) also ensures that MC follows Carth to the Vulkar Base
- [Door Clip](<../Major Glitches/Door Clipping#partial-door-clips>) and [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#vulkar-base-dlz>) to enter Vulkar Base:
  - As Carth, run into right corner of Vulkar Base door
  - While running forward, swap to MC; Carth should bump out from the corner
  - As MC, run into right corner and while running, QS/QL
  - If the trick worked, you'll [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#vulkar-base-dlz>) into the Vulkar Base after the QL
  - If the trick failed, just run into the corner and QS/QL again
  - You must have Solo Mode ON and V-Sync OFF for this [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#vulkar-base-dlz>) to work
- Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the load screen immediately after the [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#vulkar-base-dlz>)
- Use the pop-up to [Neo Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#neo-hotshots>) to South Apartments using Slot 1
- Transit Back to the Lower City

### Bek Base

- In the Lower City, **Hard Save in Slot 2**
- [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#bek-base-dlz>) into the Bek Base
- As Carth, [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#gadon-dlz>) to enter Gadon's Office
  - Doing this DLZ with Carth spawns you next to Gadon, guaranteeing one Sneak Attack
  - Re-enable V-Sync once you load into Gadon's Office (before or after the convo)
- Kill Gadon:
  - As MC, Sniper Shot for Sneak Attack
  - ***Recommended:*** As Carth, Power Blast Gadon
  - Gadon should die in one round; if unlucky, he may take two
  - It is possible but unlikely to die here if you get bad combat luck
  - Note that Kaeira doesn't have to die
- As soon as Gadon is dead, activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) via QS
- [Neo Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#neo-hotshots>) to the Vulkar Base using Slot 1

### Escaping Taris

- Kandon will accost you shortly after spawning in
- After loading into Swoop Platform, [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip the Ithorian convo
- Use [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) to skip a swoop race
  - Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) via QS
  - Speak to the race coordinator: 1
  - Finish the race with the quit dialog open
  - Don't shift into the final gear; doing so is actually slower by about a second
  - Use your pop-up to [skip the mechanic conversation](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch#skipping-cutscenes>) when Anglu comes running up 
- [Neo Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#neo-hotshots>) to Lower City using Slot 2
  - Talk to the Ithorian a second time to "win" the second swoop race
  - Click twice then IMMEDIATELY activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) via QS and open the Options Menu
  - Perform the [Neo Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#neo-hotshots>) from there
  - Alternately, you can [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) after the 2nd Ithorian convo to skip the Brejik fight, then do the [Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#neo-hotshots>)
  - If you forgot to save in Lower City, you can instead use the Autosave to do a [QS Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#quick-save-hotshots>) to Lower City
- Enter Javyar's Cantina
- Talk to Canderous: 1,1,1,2,1
  - *Party: Keep Canderous when prompted*
  - Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the subsequent load screen
- Use a [Free Look AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch#free-look-amgs>) to skip the Taris destruction CS
- Use [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) to skip Davik's Estate
  - Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the load screen into Davik's Estate
  - Go through the conversation spamming 1 and left-click (don't use NumPad Enter!)
  - When the cutscene moves to the hangar, [AMG Skip](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch#skipping-cutscenes>) the CS via QS/QL
- *Equip MC: Unequip Carth's Blaster, Equip Vibroblade Mainhand*
  - This lets us use [Weapon Flourish movement](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch#moving-during-cutscenes>) during certain cutscenes later
- Board the Ebon Hawk, then use a [Map CS Skip](<../Techniques/Map Cutscene Skips>) to Return to Ebon Hawk
  - This skips the cutscenes between Taris and Dantooine, as well as the fighter skirmish 

## Dantooine

### Jedi Enclave

- As soon as you load in, run forward until Bastila accosts you
- Use a [Conversation Queue](<../Techniques/Conversation Queue>) to skip Belaya's conversation
  - Swap to Canderous, talk to MC, then immediately swap to MC and run away, into the Enclave
  - When you reach the atrium (just past Belaya), **Hard Save in Slot 2**, then load the Hard Save to cancel the [Queue](<../Techniques/Conversation Queue>)
- [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#enclave-dlz>) to the Courtyard
  - Deactivate V-Sync for this and the other Dantooine [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone>)s
  - Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the subsequent load screen

### Dantooine Savannah

- Use the pop-up to set up a [Fast Lane](<../Major Glitches/Fast Lane#quicker-fast-lanes>)
- Set up a [Conversation Queue](<../Techniques/Conversation Queue>) with Canderous following MC
  - This skips a conversation with Jon and a Kath Hound spawning CS
- Run through the Courtyard and down the left path to the ruins entrance
- Use the [Fast Lane](<../Major Glitches/Fast Lane#quicker-fast-lanes>) pop-up to [Door Clip](<../Major Glitches/Door Clipping#party-spawn-door-clips>) into the Ruins Entrance via slight angle clipping
- Once inside the entrance, use Canderous to [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#ruins-entry-dlz>) into the ruins

### Ancient Ruins

- Swap to MC and run forward
- *Party: Keep Bastila when prompted*
- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip ancient droid conversation
  - Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the load screen
- [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#ruins-star-map-dlz>) to activate the Star Map cutscene
  - Once it starts, [AMG Skip](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch#skipping-cutscenes>) the CS via QS/QL
- Re-enable V-Sync in Options
  - We won't need to [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone>) again until Lehon
- [Neo Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#neo-hotshots>) to the Jedi Enclave using Slot 2
- QS/QL to warp Bastila to the Council Chamber
  - If you got the [Enclave DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#enclave-dlz>) quickly, Bastila will still be outside the council chamber

  - Throw Thermal Detonators with both MC and Bastila to defeat Malak's first phase
  - If you run out of detonators, use Bastila's Throw Lightsaber for slow but guaranteed damage
  - MC may die to Malak's Force Lightning; this slows down the fight but Bastila can finish him by herself
  - As Malak gets knocked back, you may need to cancel combat and requeue thermals so you don't miss him
  - Try to get into a good rhythm of swapping between your party members and throwing thermals to keep Malak mostly stunlocked
  - Anytime before the first phase ends, activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) via QS
  - When Malak's conversation starts, click through to the first dialog option
  - Press Enter to simultaneously cancel the pop-up dialog and select the first conversation option
  - Immediately [AMG Skip](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch#skipping-cutscenes>) the CS via QS/QL

## Closing

If you made it this far, congratulations! Thanks for reading the guide. Please let indykenobi know if you have any comments or questions (best way to contact is on Discord).

I'd like to acknowledge glasnonck and thinkshooter, whose runs got me into KotOR speedrunning, as well as glasnonck, Lane, HotShotWire and the rest of the KotOR community for tossing around ideas and breaking this game so much that we can have an All Star Maps category that's different from Any%!

Extra shoutout to glasnonck for his Walkmesh Visualizer tool, which made plotting out the coordinate warps in the midgame possible without going insane.
