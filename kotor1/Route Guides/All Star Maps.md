# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - All Star Maps Guide

### v3.0: Male/Female Scoundrel Route

*Route and Guide by [indykenobi](https://www.speedrun.com/users/indykenobi)*

This route defeats Malak on the Star Forge as fast as possible while obtaining all five individual Star Maps.  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black at the start of the Malak Death cutscene. A load-removal tool and auto-splitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to [glasnonck](https://www.speedrun.com/users/glasnonck) and [XeroHR](https://www.speedrun.com/users/XeroHR) (results may vary for Windows 11 users); times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent. This guide will cover the character build and detailed route for the run.

Finally, if you have additional questions, you can check out the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu). There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

## Category Definition

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

All Star Maps (ASM) requires each Star Map object to be opened individually on each planet: Dantooine, Korriban, Tatooine, Manaan, and Kashyyyk.  You do *not* have to obtain the Star Map quest items.  ASM uses the Unrestricted ruleset only; currently, neither the NMG nor Glitchless rulesets can skip a Star Map normally, so for those rulesets there would be no difference between Any% and ASM.

Thus any glitches are allowed, including the Routine.  However, all KotOR speedruns ban the following:

- Abusing the windowed nature of the game to teleport a character (including Super Save Teleports)
- Severe underclocking of oneâ€™s monitor to increase Save Teleport distance
- Abusing the load removal to excessively pause the timer
- Loading saves created prior to the run
- Use of mods or other external tools to modify the software in any way

## Route Overview

This route skips Jedi training on Dantooine, instead using [Coordinate Warps](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) and [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to move quickly.  The run should begin with *no save files*; eventually we will use six total save slots.

A brief outline of the route for the ASM run, including planet order and major skips:

*1. Endar Spire*

* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) into the starboard section
* Use a [Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) and second [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) to activate the Plot Armor glitch
* Reach Taris

*2. Taris*

* Perform [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>) to get Sneak Attack IX and Improved/Master Two-Weapon Fighting
* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#sith-base-dlz>) into the Sith Base
* Kill and loot the Sith Governor to obtain Taris Launch Codes
* Reach the Lower City with a [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#lower-city-dlz>)
* [Door Clip](<../Major Glitches/Door Clipping>) into the Vulkar Base door to [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#vulkar-base-dlz>) into the Vulkar Base
* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#bek-base-dlz>) into the Bek Base and [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#gadon-dlz>) to kill Gadon Thek
* [Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) to Vulkar Base and use [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) to skip one swoop race
* [Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) to Javyar's Cantina and recruit Canderous
* Use [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) to steal the Ebon Hawk and escape Taris

*3. Dantooine*

* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#enclave-dlz>) to the Courtyard
* [Door Clip](<../Major Glitches/Door Clipping>) past the Ruins door and [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#ruins-entry-dlz>) into the Ruins
* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#ruins-star-map-dlz>) to get the Star Map

*4. Midgame Setup*

* Reach the Valley of the Dark Lords
* Reach the Upper Shadowlands
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Bastila to Valley of the Dark Lords
* Enter the Tomb of Naga Sadow
* Reach West Central
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Bastila to Upper Shadowlands
* Reach Lower Shadowlands
* [Autosave Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#autosave-hotshots>) to West Central
* Reach East Central

*5. Map Collection*

* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to get the Kashyyyk Star Map
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to reach Hrakert Station
* Get the Hunting License from the Czerka Office in Anchorhead
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to get the Korriban Star Map
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to get the Envirosuit and reach Sea Floor
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee from a STUNT module to the Sea Floor to skip the disguise
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to Anchorhead to reach the Dune Sea
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to Kolto Control to reach Hrakert Rift
* [Autosave Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#autosave-hotshots>) to Hrakert Rift to get the Manaan Star Map
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Jolee to Dune Sea via Upper Shadowlands to reach Eastern Dune Sea
* Krayt Dragon Skip to get the Tatooine Star Map

*6. Lehon*

* Use Fighter Skirmish skip to spawn on Lehon
* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#temple-entry-dlz>) to enter the Ancient Temple
* [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#temple-summit-dlz>) to reach the summit
* Use [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) to skip the Bastila fight and fall to the Dark Side
* Use a [Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) to skip repairing the Ebon Hawk 
* Fly to the Star Forge

*7. Star Forge*

* [GP Warp](<../Techniques/GP Warp>) and [Double Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) to skip Deck 1
* [GP Warp](<../Techniques/GP Warp>) and [Double Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) to skip the Star Forge Computer
* [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) Bastila to Viewing Platform
* Kill Darth Malak with Thermal Detonators and an [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>)

This route used to obtain either Sith Armor or the Sand People Outfit so a [Fast Lane](<../Major Glitches/Fast Lane>) could be used to remove the Envirosuit.  These can now be skipped thanks to the STUNT module [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) to Sea Floor and the [Autosave Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#autosave-hotshots>) to Hrakert Rift.  Those two warps, along with the [Coordinate Warp](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#coordinate-warping>) to the Envirosuit, also enable Plot Armor Skip (if desired), since these are the only points that would have a high risk of death (other than the Taris Sith Base).

## Character Build

We begin as a Scoundrel; this guide as written can be completed as either a Male or Female character, with no time difference.  Scoundrel is picked for its access to Sneak Attack IX, which is abused to quickly kill the Sith Governor and Gadon Thek.

### Character Creation

**Initial Attributes:**
* Str - 8
* Dex - 16/18
* Con - 18/16
* Int - 8
* Wis - 10
* Cha - 10

**Initial Skills:**
* Awareness - 4
* Persuade - 4
* Security - 4

**Initial Feat:** - Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols -or- Two-Weapon Fighting (*see below*)

### Leveling Plan

*Level 2: [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>) to obtain:*
- Improved or Master Two-Weapon Fighting
- Sneak Attack IX 

There are two feat builds to take; the fastest build is to take Two-Weapon Fighting at character creation and use the fastest form of [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>) to get Improved Two-Weapon Fighting and Sneak Attack IX.  The downside to this is weaker chances to hit on our three fights, so if you prefer to improve your odds by 15% per attack, you can instead take Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols at character creation and do the slower (All Quests) version of the [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>).

We end the run at level 2 due to all the [Hotshots](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot>) we do, so this is the only choice to make regarding character build.

**Character Build Notes:**

- *Attributes:* Dexterity aids our chance to hit with blaster pistols for our two fights, while Constitution gives us a higher chance to survive in the Taris Sith Base.  It's personal preference whether to choose 18 Dex (for maximum chance to hit the Governor and Gadon) or 18 Con (for maximum Vitality).  We choose pistols over melee weapons to abuse the +10 Ranged vs. Melee bonus, especially since one of our two fights is done via Wire Targeting.  10 Wisdom is used for saving throws against stunning powers, while 10 Charisma is required for some Persuade checks on Kashyyyk.
- *Skills:* Persuade is used to Persuade Yuthura and Lashowe on Korriban.  Security is only necessary for a skip on Endar Spire that allows us to skip Trask.  Points in Awareness allow us to see some mines to avoid them, but they're not really necessary.
- *Feats:* Improved/Master Two-Weapon Fighting and Sneak Attack IX allow us to take out Gadon and the Sith Governor in short-order.  Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols can help our chance to hit slightly if that build is chosen.  We use Sniper Shot as our main combat feat because it's the default combat feat for Scoundrels.

## Endar Spire

*Before beginning, disable VSync in Advanced Graphics Options if you are using the Rubble [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) on Endar Spire.  This makes the [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) more consistent.*

### Character Creation

- Male/Female Scoundrel - Custom Character
- Dex to 16/18, Con to 18/16, Wis to 10, Cha to 10
- Awareness to 4, Persuade to 4, Security to 4
- Initial Feat: Two-Weapon Fighting *or* Weapon Focus: Blaster Pistols
- Pick a good name!
- Hit Play! (and be ready to [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>)!)

### Command Module

- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip the intro CS
- 
- [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) into the Starboard Section through one of the following two methods:
  - ***Method One: Rubble [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>)***
    - *This strat is potentially 20 seconds faster, but the [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) is marginally harder.  This is the recommended method.*
    - *To perform this strat:*
      - Skip the footlocker and talking to Trask
      - [Open Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#open-buffers>) past Trask to use Security during Trask's first conversation
      - [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) by walking into the rubble near the second Sith soldier in the right spot
  - ***Method Two: Doorframe [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone)***
    - *This strat is much more consistent, but significantly slower than a good Rubble [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>).  It's recommended only for beginning runners.*
    - *To perform this strat:*
      - Loot footlocker
      - *Equip MC: Clothes*
      - Open door and Talk to Trask twice
      - [Open Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#open-buffers>) to use Security during the Carth CS
      - Kill first two Sith and open next door
      - [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) by walking into the right side of the door frame in the right spot

### Starboard Section

- ***Optional Strat: Plot Armor***  
  - *This strat grants a minimum HP of 1 (called "Plot Armor" for short) for the rest of the run, but requires redoing the Spire DLZ and costs a minimum of 10 seconds (but likely more). The run can be done without it, but this strat provides a little safety if desired.*
  - *To obtain Plot Armor:*
    - Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the load screen after the prior [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>)
    - After Carth's convo starts, [access the Options Menu](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch#accessing-menus>) to **Hard Save in New Slot (Slot 1)**
    - Immediately load the Slot 1 Hard Save and activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the load
      - This keeps your QS in the Command Module
    - Perform the [QS Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#quick-save-hotshots>) to return to the Command Module
    - [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) into the Starboard Section again, using whatever method you used before     
  - *If you choose not to use the above strat:*
    - Activate [AMG](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch) on the load screen for the Starboard Section
    - After Carth's convo starts, [begin moving to the next room](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch#moving-during-cutscenes) while Carth narrates  
    - QS next to the footlocker to end the CS
- Loot footlocker in Terminal Room

  - This also moves the Blaster Pistol in Carth's offhand to MC's offhand



- Exit to Upper City South

### Upper City South

- ***Optional Strat: Default Spawn Warp***
  - *This strat uses [The Routine](<../Major Glitches/The Routine>) to warp to the default spawn in Upper City South, just outside Zelka's clinic.  It's a very complicated glitch that saves only 2-3 seconds, so it's only recommended for top runners.*
  - *To perform this strat:*
    - Return to the Hideout
    - Perform [The Routine](<../Major Glitches/The Routine>) to delete Upper City South and the Hideout from your save file

## Closing

If you made it this far, congratulations! Thanks for reading the guide. Please let indykenobi know if you have any comments or questions (best way to contact is on Discord).

I'd like to acknowledge glasnonck and thinkshooter, whose runs got me into KotOR speedrunning, as well as glasnonck, Lane, HotShotWire and the rest of the KotOR community for tossing around ideas and breaking this game so much that we can have an All Star Maps category that's different from Any%!

Extra shoutout to glasnonck for his Walkmesh Visualizer tool, which made plotting out the coordinate warps in the midgame possible without going insane.
