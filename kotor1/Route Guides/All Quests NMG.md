# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - All Quests No Major Glitches Guide 

### v2.0: Male Scout -> Jedi Guardian Route

*Route and Guide by [indykenobi](https://www.speedrun.com/users/indykenobi) and [BinksMagnus](https://www.speedrun.com/users/BinksMagnus)*

This route completes all 100 main and side quests in the game without the use of major glitches.  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black at the start of the Malak Death cutscene. A load-removal tool and auto-splitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to [Lane](https://www.speedrun.com/users/Lane), [glasnonck](https://www.speedrun.com/users/glasnonck) and [XeroHR](https://www.speedrun.com/users/XeroHR). Times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent.

Dark side or light side quest conclusions are chosen based on overall speed for the route.  This guide will cover the character creation and leveling choices, as well as reasoning for each quest's chosen completion and a detailed route.

If you need assistance with the glitches used in the game, I recommend the Techniques section of the [Glitch Guides](https://kotor-speedruns.github.io/kotor1/#glitch-guides).  You can either review those guides ahead of time, or use the hyperlinks in the guide below to consult the more detailed material when necessary.  You can also join the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](https://discord.gg/6WpNfRZ) and ask questions if you have them!

## Category Rules

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

### All Quests Category

For All Quests runs, you must complete the game with either ending on any difficulty, and complete all 100 quests. Completing a quest is defined as any of the following three conditions:

1. The quest appears in the "Completed Quests" section of the journal.
2. If the quest is entirely removed from the journal when completed, it must appear in the "Active Quests" section of the journal first.
3. If a quest is completed but then becomes active again, it must be completed again.

Out of the 100 quests, 91 of them can at some point be moved to the "Completed Quests" section of the Journal and thus satisfy condition 1.  

The quest "The Jedi Council" is (with the current route) the only quest that reactivates and thus falls under condition 3.  It is completed both times by satisfying condition 2, as the quest is never placed in the Completed Quests section of the Journal.  The following eight quests are removed entirely from the Journal instead of becoming Completed Quests, and thus must satisfy condition 2:
- Invited to a Party
- The Jedi Council (for both completions)
- The Ebon Hawk
- Sunry's Story
- Elora, Sunry's Wife
- Gluupor, the Rodian
- Ignus, the Hotel Owner
- Firith Me, the Pazaak Player

The final quest is the last one in the game, "The Final Confrontation".  The game actually never bothers to update that quest at any point after giving it to you, so for the purposes of the speedrun it is considered to be complete when Malak is defeated (when the timer stops).

### NMG Ruleset

## Character Build

### Character Creation

Male Scout - Choosing a Male character is faster in two places: starting the "Invited to a Party" quest on Taris requires going further into the Upper City Cantina as a Female MC, and you have to do 4 additional conversations with Carth to complete his quest.  This guide will assume a Male MC.

Scout is picked for automatic access to Flurry, Implant Level 2 and Computer Use as a Class Skill.

**Initial Attributes**
- 18 Str
- 12 Dex
- 12 Con
- 10 Int
- 8 Wis
- 12 Cha

**Initial Skills**
* Computer Use - 4
* Security - 1
* Treat Injury - 4
* Save the rest

**Initial Feat** - Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons

The attribute spread maximizes damage while striking a balance between durability and utility.  18 Strength is to maximize our damage with melee weapons.  The points in Dexterity and Constitution are to give us some survivability.  The 10 Intelligence gives us enough skill points to invest points where we need to put them early on and still save enough to max out Persuade when we become a Jedi.  The 12 Charisma guarantees that we succeed at difficult Persuade checks while Force Valor is active.

For skills, we need will use Computer Use to help save on spikes throughout the run, Treat Injury to make our inevitable medpac use more effective, and Persuade to take some conversational shortcuts and finish some quests. Security helps optimize Endar Spire and lets the Main Character open some apartment doors while Carth kills stuff.

We choose Weapon Focus: Melee for the attack boost on Taris, in particular the fights with Selven, the Dueling Ring, and everything in the Sith Base. We choose it over Two-Weapon Fighting because it takes longer to select, so at level 2 it's faster to pick Two-Weapon Fighting. Since character creation isn't timed, this is optimal, and since you only have one melee weapon equipped on the Endar Spire there is no additional point at which you would benefit from it by taking Two-Weapon Fighting at Creation.

### Leveling Plan


| Level | Feat | Power | Skills |
|---| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons, *Flurry* | | Com to 4, Stealth to 1, Sec to 1, TI to 4 |
| 2 | Two-Weapon Fighting | | Save All |
| 3 | Empathy | | Save All |
| 4 | *Implant 2, Uncanny Dodge* | | Save All |
| 5 | Improved Two-Weapon Fighting | | Save All |
| 6 | Improved Flurry, *Force Jump* | Burst of Speed, Force Valor | Save All |
| 7 | | Affect Mind | Per to 10, TI to 8 |
| 8 | Master Two-Weapon Fighting | Dominate Mind | Per to 11 |
| 9 | | Knight Speed | Per to 12 |
| 10 | | Knight Valor | Per to 13 |
| 11 | Master Flurry, *Improved Force Jump* | Force Resistance | Per to 14 |
| 12 | Weapon Focus: Lightsaber | Drain Life | Per to 15 |
| 13 | | Energy Resistance | Per to 16 |
| 14 | Weapon Specialization: Lightsaber | Improved Energy Resistance | Per to 17 |
| 15 | | Master Speed | Per to 18 |

Our main plan is to combine Master Speed with Master Flurry and a Double-Bladed Lightsaber for five attacks per round in the late game.  Master Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Focus, stims and lightsaber crystals give us enough attack that we can reliably hit even with the attack penalties.

**Notes on Feats and Powers:**
- We take Empathy at level 3 to gain a small boost to Persuade and Treat Injury; no other feat is as useful at that level.
- Implant Level 2 is granted for free at Level 4, allowing us to equip the Nerve Enhancement Package.
- We reach level 5 on Taris so that we can be as strong as possible for the Bendak and Sith Base fights.  Level 6 is saved for when we become a Jedi so we can take Speed, Valor, and Affect Mind before leaving Dantooine.
- For Feats, we stack everything we can that improves our chance to hit; Master Flurry, Master Two-Weapon Fighting, and Weapon Focus/Specialization: Lightsaber are the key feats we get.
- Force Speed is the key to our combat build and early movement; Master Speed is critical to get as many attacks in as possible.
- Force Valor helps us out on pretty much every key fight starting with the Elite Sand People Warriors and going all the way up to Darth Malak.
- Force Resistance can be used on Star Forge to help protect against hostile Force Powers, particularly on Deck 2.
- Dominate Mind allows us to pass Persuade checks on Czerka guards on Kashyyyk and Lashowe on Korriban.  Affect Mind allows us to access Manaan, Tatooine and Kashyyyk without paying the docking fee, among other things.

**Notes on Skills and Attributes:**
- The 10 points in Intelligence allow us to get 4 net Computer Use, saving 1 spike per hacking with our MC and smoothing out the spike route on Taris.
- The 1 point in Stealth causes a Stealth Field Generator to spawn in the first footlocker on Endar Spire, which we then sell for 40 extra credits, netting us a extra concussion grenade.
- The 1 point in Security is for a skip on the Endar Spire, and to open a couple apartments on Taris.
- 12 Charisma, along with maxing Persuade and Force Valor guarantees passing every Persuade check in the game.  We keep putting points in Persuade because as we level because we need more Persuasion to continue to pass important Persuade checks, all the way through sparing Bastila on the Star Forge.
- 8 in Treat Injury helps us preserve some medpacs and increases survivability.  4 in TI is usually enough to get through Taris; if desired, you can take more points in TI at each level on Taris to be very slightly safer.

## Equipment Plan

**Implant: Nerve Enhancement Package** - Bought on Taris, Zelka's Shop (500 Credits)
- A convenient source of Immunity: Mind-Affecting, protecting us from a host of Dark Jedi abilities and other status effects that slow us down.

**Head: Breath Mask** - Bought on Dantooine, Crattis Yurkal's shop (100 Credits)
- This cheap hat gives Immunity: Poison, which is convenient mostly for defending against the related Force powers from Dark Jedi.

**Gloves: GenoHaradan Power Gloves** - Received on Manaan from Hulas
- The reward for killing Ithorak, +4 Strength is only bested by the +5 Dominator Gauntlets, which cost way too much for the marginal upgrade.

**Body: Jedi Knight Robe** - Found on Dantooine, Nemo's corpse
- Easily accessible on the critical path, and good enough for our needs.

**Belt: CNS Strength Enhancer** - Bought on Dantooine, Crattis Yurkal's shop (8500 Credits)
- A belt that gives +2 Strength and +2 to all saving throws helps on both offense and defense.

**Weapon: Double-Bladed Lightsaber** - Found on Taris, Brejik's corpse
- We borrow Bastila's lightsaber for the bulk of the game.  This allows us to use Force Jump, as well as maximize the effects of the Solari and Krayt Dragon Pearls that we place into it.  It's also free, which reduces the strain on the credit route quite a bit compared to the alternatives.
- Crystals Used:
    - Sigil Crystal: Placed after Dantooine 1, used for +1 Attack (and a small damage boost)
    - Krayt Dragon Pearl: Placed after Tatooine 1, gives a huge +3 Attack as well as +2 Energy damage
    - Solari Crystal: The best crystal in the game and the reason we want to be Light-aligned in endgame. Replaces Sigil after Lehon, gives +3 Attack, +3 Physical damage, and +1d8 damage vs. Dark Side enemies, which the final three major combat encounters happen to put us against.

## Credit Route

The major purchases made during the run are the CNS Strength Enhancer, HK-47, and a large amount of adrenal stims and medpacs for fights.  The credit route is extremely tight early on and stops being a concern after Manaan 1.

**1. Larrim on Taris**
- *Sell*: Unneeded Items to reach about 1194 Credits
- *Buy:* 2x Concussion Grenade and Battle Stimulant (~908 Credits)

**2. Zelka Forn on Taris**
- *Buy*: Nerve Enhancement Package, 5x Adrenal Alacrity, 2x Adrenal Strength (~58 Credits)

**3. Kebla Yurt on Taris**
- *Buy*: Concussion Grenade (~28 Credits)

**4. Janice Nall on Taris**
- *Sell*: Unneeded Items to reach about 6072 Credits

**5. Crattis Yurkal on Dantooine**
- *Buy*: CNS Strength Enhancer, Breath Mask, 3x Adrenal Alacrity, 1x Adrenal Strength, 1x Adrenal Stamina, +/-3, +/-5 Pazaak Cards (~22 Credits)

**6. Mic'Tunan'Jus Orgu on Tatooine**
- *Sell*: Unneeded Items to reach about 6538 Credits
- *Buy*: 4x Life Support Packs, ~14x Advanced Medpacs, Adrenal Strength, Bantha Fodder (~4767 Credits)

**7. Selkath Merchant on Manaan**
- *Buy*: 7x Parts, 5x All Hyper Stims (~447 Credits)

**8. Junix Nard on Tatooine**
- *Buy*: All Pazaak Cards, Hair Trigger (~7797 Credits)

**9. Czerka Store on Korriban**
- *Buy*: All Echani and Hyper Stims (~1200 Credits)

Notice that we sell as much as possible to Janice Nall on Taris; shops on Taris give 40% of item value for sell prices, compared to 25% off of Taris, so we maximize our credits that way.

In addition to selling items, other major sources of credits include:
- Duel Ring rewards
- Taris Bounty and Rakghoul Serum rewards
- Manaan Swoop Races

## Alignment Route

Alignment in KotOR is a sliding scale from 0 to 100, initialized at 50; higher numbers are Light, lower numbers are Dark. Shifts in alignment are determined by a matrix; every alignment-shifting action is classified as Light or Dark, and then assigned a level (either Low, Mid, or High). The player character can be aligned as Very Dark, Dark, Neutral, Light, or Very Light. The more opposed your alignment and the action's classification, the more drastic your shift in alignment; for example, a Light-aligned character performing a High Dark action will have a large shift, while a Dark character performing a High Dark action will have a smaller shift.

### Alignment Shifts

Here's the full list of alignment actions that happen during the run; there are 46 total shifts, of which exactly 27 are dark and 16 are light:

| Aligned | Action | Type | Delta | New |
|---| :--- | :--- |---|---|
| Neutral | Game Start | -- | 50 | 50 |
| Neutral | Threaten Dia about Holdan | Low Dark | -2 | 48 |
| Neutral | Kill Dia | Low Dark | -2 | 46 |
| Neutral | Kill Largo | Low Dark | -2 | 44 |
| Neutral | Kill the Infected Outcasts | Low Dark | -2 | 42 |
| Neutral | Give Rukil the Promised Land journals | High Light | +6 | 48 |
| Neutral | Agree to kill Gadon Thek | Low Dark | -2 | 46 |
| Neutral | Agree to a death match with Bendak Starkiller | Low Dark | -2 | 44 |
| Neutral | Threaten Ajuur for more credits | Low Dark | -2 | 42 |
| Neutral | Threaten Janice Nall for T3 | Low Dark | -4 | 38 |
| Dark | Sell the Rakghoul Serum to Zax | Low Dark | -1 | 37 |
| Dark | Kill Tanis | Mid Dark | -2 | 35 |
| Dark | Kill Komad Fortuna | Low Dark | -1 | 34 |
| Dark | Order Sasha off your ship | Mid Dark | -2 | 32 |
| Dark | Lie to Nubassa about the gizka | Low Dark | -1 | 31 |
| Dark | Kill Lorgal via the console | Low Dark | -1 | 30 |
| Dark | Loan Queedle money for his swoop bike | Mid Light | +6 | 36 |
| Dark | Try to refuse Queedle's return of the loan | Low Light | +4 | 40 |
| Neutral | Give Casus's journal to Nurik for free | Low Light | +2 | 42 |
| Neutral | Refuse reward from Shen and Rahasia | Low Light | +2 | 44 |
| Neutral | Kill Zuulan | Low Dark | -2 | 42 |
| Neutral | Kill Rulan | Low Dark | -2 | 40 |
| Dark | | Low Dark | -2 | 38 |
| Dark | Kashyyyk Star Map Quiz | Low Light | +4 | 42 |
| Neutral | | Low Dark | -2 | 40 |
| Neutral | Kill Freyyr | High Dark | -6 | 34 |
| Dark | Report Freyyr's death to Chuundar | High Dark | -4 | 30 |
| Dark | Tell Matton not to kill Eli | High Light | +8 | 38 |
| Dark | Buy Sharina's wraid plate for half price | Low Dark | -2 | 37 |
| Dark | Kill Ithorak | Low Dark | -1 | 36 |
| Dark | Threaten to kill Shasa | High Dark | -4 | 32 |
| Dark | Persuade Kel Algwinn to return to the Jedi | Hardcoded | +3 | 35 |
| Dark | Give Dustil evidence of Uthar's betrayal | High Light | +8 | 43 |
| Neutral | Use serum on the Mandalorian prisoner | Hardcoded | -3 | 40 |
| Neutral | Use serum on the Mandalorian prisoner again | Hardcoded | -3 | 37 |
| Dark | Give dark answers during Jorak Uln's quiz | Mid Dark | -2 | 35 |
| Neutral | Tell the renegade Sith that they're free | High Light | +8 | 43 |
| Neutral | Spare Yuthura Ban | Mid Light | +4 | 47 |
| Neutral | | Low Light | +2 | 49 |
| Neutral | Remain true to the Light Side on Lehon | High Light | +6 | 55 |
| Neutral | | Highest Light | +10 | 65 |

The alignment route is quite lenient, since we no longer try to equip the Solari crystal until after Lehon, when we get a massive infusion of light side points when we choose to renounce our former identity.

The ending for the run is the light side ending; see below.

### Quest Alignment Choices

In general, every quest outcome is chosen to get the fastest time, regardless of alignment. Some notes on some non-intuitive choices:

**1. Dia's Bounty - Dark**
- We kill Dia on Taris because it's faster than Persuading Holdan to drop the bounty, since you'd have to talk to Zax twice in that case, then Transit Back and talk to Dia.

**2. The Promised Land - Light**
- Giving Rukil the Promised Land journals is faster because you must give him the apprentice's journal, and you can turn in the other journals in the same conversation.  We also don't need Igear's pitiful credit reward.

**3. Rakghoul Serum - Dark**
- Selling the Rakghoul Serum to Zax is faster than visiting Zelka a second time or delaying his shopping trip, since we have to talk to Zax anyway for the bounty quests and delaying the Adrenal Alacrity we get from Zelka would make Taris much slower overall.

**4. Tanis Trapped - Dark**
- Killing Tanis is faster than solving the droid puzzles to save him.

**5. A Desert Hunt - Dark**
- We kill Komad to avoid having to talk to him later, and for a second Krayt Pearl, as this allows us to use one in our lightsaber and the second for the quest Worthy of History.

**6. Manaan Swoop Races - Light**
- Loaning Queedle money before doing the Manaan Swoop Races saves time because otherwise you're forced to talk to Huxta Jax between the second and third swoop races.

**7. Mission for the Republic - Neutral**
- We save the Mother Firaxan on Manaan because killing her locks us out of both the Republic Hiring Mercenaries and the Missing Selkath sidequests; it is also just barely slower than killing her.

**8. A Chieftain in Need - Dark**
- We kill Freyyr because it's faster overall for a variety of reasons. We avoid having to kill the Ritual Beast, we avoid having to fight Chuundar and his lackeys, Gorwooken will take us straight to Chuundar as we exit the Shadowlands, and we avoid having to complete Wookiee Lost the normal way as it auto-completes instead when Chuundar kicks us out of the village.

**9. Star Map: Kashyyyk - Dark** 
- We give the "correct" answers during the Star Map quiz on Kashyyyk because it's faster than giving Light Side answers and having to fight the Defense Droids.  Ironically, because we have exactly 40 alignment when this is happening and the second answer causes a Light Side shift, this entire conversation results in no net alignment shift, despite the fact that we're giving mostly "Dark Side" answers.

**10. Middleman - Dark**
- We give Sharina half the credits she asks for because it's faster to mash through the cutscene than it is to select dialogue.

**11. Korriban Sidequests and Prestige** 
- Many of the Korriban choices are made because we can only turn in five prestige points before Uthar stops accepting other quests.  Choosing the Dark Mandalorian Weapons Cache, Light Doubting Sith, Neutral Ajunta Pall's Sword, and Light Renegade Sith allows those sidequests to be completed without talking to Uthar; this leaves only five quests (Code of the Sith, Hermit in the Hills, Rogue Droid, Aiding Lashowe, and Double-Double Cross) that require getting a prestige point from Uthar.  The only other possibility is Neutral Renegade Sith and Light Rogue Droid, but that gives less experience, which risks not having Master Speed for the Star Forge.  In addition, the animations for repairing the droid take a surprisingly long time.

**12. Finding Dustil - Light** 
- Choosing to give Dustil the evidence of Uthar's treachery is just barely slower, but prevents having to fight him, and we have to go into Uthar's Room anyways.

**13. Hermit in the Hills - Dark** 
- Choosing the Dark Hermit in the Hills completion is faster and prevents having to fight Jorak Uln, who's actually kind of a pain.

**14. Trapped on a Nameless World - Light**
- We stay true to the Light Side on Lehon because otherwise the "Juhani" quest does not complete.  It also makes the Star Forge faster in the NMG ruleset, since we would otherwise have to bring Bastila through the Star Forge with us.

## Route Overview

### Planet Route

Taris -> Dantooine 1 -> Tatooine 1 -> Manaan 1 -> Dantooine 2 -> Kashyyyk -> Tatooine 2 -> Manaan 2 -> Leviathan -> Korriban -> Unknown Planet -> Star Forge

Some planets require at least two visits, such as:
- Manaan: You must visit to trigger the GenoHaradan quests, then leave to kill the targets, then return to finish them.
- Dantooine: The Zuulan bounty for the GenoHaradan is here, and can only be done on a second visit.

Planets that can be done in a single visit include:
- Korriban: Korriban does not require two visits if you get its Star Map last, since then you can do the Premium Merchant quest at that time.  The Premium Merchant quest is only available after the Leviathan.
- Kashyyyk: Kashyyyk can be done in one visit, as long as you visit Manaan first to trigger the GenoHaradan bounty for Rulan.

Tatooine could be done in a single visit if our route was different, but since we visit it first it's not possible.
- We don't visit Manaan first because ideally we'd like to have already encountered Senni Vek to start the GenoHaradan quest with Hulas, which we need two Star Maps (including the one on Dantooine) to do.
- We don't visit Kashyyyk first because it would require a second visit to kill Rulan.
- We don't visit Korriban first because we would need to revisit for the Premium Merchant quest and for Dustil, who won't appear until you've been approached by Jordo. Some of the combat encounters here would also be quite difficult.

This route does not visit Yavin space station, and therefore does not get the Baragwin Assault Blade or the Advanced Bio-Stabilizer Mask.  But we save time by not having to visit Suvam three times.

- Defeat and redeem Bastila
- Defeat Darth Malak

## Detailed Route

This section will describe all the actions you'll need to take for the All Quests NMG run.

### Crash Awareness

KotOR has a significant memory leak associated with the Quick Save feature, which is used heavily in this speedrun and is what allows a significant portion of NMG's glitches to work. It is recommended to speedrun with the Task Manager open in order to monitor Memory usage and also to close the game at several points. It is recommended to close and restart the game around 1400-1450 MB of memory used, as the game will crash unpredictably between 1500 and 1600 MB. This is a very small margin, and being aware of your memory usage is a vital component of finishing runs and getting good times.

- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) to skip Canderous’s friend accosting you
- `Level Bastila to 4: Charisma to 16, Save Skills, Burst of Speed`
  - Increasing her Charisma to 16 gives her just enough Force Points to cast Burst of Speed twice
- In Options -> Gameplay, activate the Auto-Level option for party members
  - This is important mainly for bulk later on, but also to automatically raise T3's Com and Security for certain actions
- *Force: Cast Burst of Speed as Bastila*

### The Duel Ring
- *Unequip MC: Remove Mission's Vibroblade*
- Single Item Dupe the Prototype Vibroblade via menu method to prep for [Damage Stacking](<../Techniques/Damage Stacking>)
- Use the following menu to perform [Damage Stacking](<../Techniques/Damage Stacking>) four times:
  - As MC, open the mainhand weapon menu, highlight none, then cycle menus (Previous Menu, then Next Menu)
  - Swap to Bastila, open the offhand weapon menu, highlight the Prototype Vibroblade, then cycle menus
  - Swap to MC, open the offhand weapon menu, then immediately press Escape to exit that menu
  - Swap to Bastila, open the mainhand weapon menu, highlight None and press Enter
  - Open the Bastila's mainhand weapon menu again, highlight Mission's Vibroblade, and press Enter
    - That finishes one stack; to reset for the next, equip a Prototype Vibroblade to both Bastila and MC's mainhands
    - After the fourth stack, leave Mission's Vibroblade on Bastila and equip the Prototype Vibroblade to MC 
      - MC's weapon stats should read 20-29 damage with a +18 to hit
      - Leave MC's offhand empty; we want to avoid the dual wielding penalty for this section
- Swap to Bastila and ensure Burst of Speed is active, then run forward until Canderous accosts you
  - ***Starts “Purchasing a Droid”***

  - Start Gerlon and Marl's duels by running to Ajuur as MC and talking to him twice
  - For each duel, run up to your opponent and use Flurry; you do not need to use bumping
  - With the [Damage Stacking](<../Techniques/Damage Stacking>), Deadeye and Gerlon are one-round fights, while Marl and Twitch are two rounds (unless you auto-miss)
  - Ice is typically one round, but could be two if you have low damage rolls
  - *Stims: Strength on MC in the arena for Ice and Twitch*
  - As soon as it is available, `Level MC to 5: Save Skills, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting`
- DO NOT talk to Ajuur after defeating Twitch
- Swap to Bastila, cast Burst of Speed, and talk to Bendak
- Leave and reenter Upper City Cantina
  - This is needed to trigger the Bendak fight, but clears the [Damage Stacking](<../Techniques/Damage Stacking>)

- As Bastila, talk to Ajuur
- Kill Bendak
  - *Stims: Alacrity, Strength, and Battle Stimulant on MC*
  - Use bumping to keep Bendak's blaster equipped as long as possible
    - This keeps the +10 Ranged on Melee attack bonus active
    - Without this bonus, Bendak is very difficult to hit
    - If he draws his sword, you can try to bait him into drawing his blaster again by running away, but this is inconsistent
  - With proper bumping and decent damage rolls, this is a 3-4 round fight
  - ***Finishes “The Dueling Ring”***
  - ***Starts “Bendak’s Bounty”***
- Talk to Ajuur twice: 2,2,2 ... mash
  - This replaces Twitch’s reward with an extra copy of Bendak’s

  - Bastila: Concussion Grenade, then Flurry x3 on Assault Droid
  - MC: Flurry x4 on Assault Droid
  - T3: Shield Disruptor x2 on right blaster turret, then Disruptor x2 on the left blaster turret
    - Make sure you use at most 4 Shield Disruptor charges during this fight 
  - The grenade has a 55% chance to stun the assault droid, which makes the fight much quicker
  - T3 may also be stunned by the grenade; if this happens, you can use MC/Bastila to clean up the turrets after the droid is destroyed 
- After all three enemies are destroyed, enter the elevator
- QS in case of death/bad luck
- Sith Governor Fight:
  - MC: Flurry x4
  - Bastila: Stun x2, Flurry x2
  - T3: Stun Ray x4
  - Bastila's Stun lowers the Governor's defense by 4 even if he saves, and an additional 4 if the 15% chance to stun actually lands
  - Each Stun Ray shot from T3 has a 25% chance to stun the governor
  - MC will deal most of the damage, particularly once the governor is stunned
  - Keep queueing Stun Rays as T3 until the governor is stunned
  - If you didn't use all 4 Shield Disruptor shots earlier, you can use some here after the Governor is stunned, but be sure to save 6 shots

  - If Governor is stunned and seems likely to die, T3 can loot the boxes during the fight

  - You'll need to swap back to T3 when you enter the hangar

  - ***Starts “The Ebon Hawk”***

## Dantooine 1

## Manaan 2

*Note: your saves are getting so big by this point that it may be extremely difficult to buffer anything from now on, but turning V-Sync Off makes it much easier. Due to the time required to toggle V-Sync off and on again, many cutscenes that can be buffered will be easier/faster to just mash through, but longer ones will be worth toggling for.*

  - ***Starts “Captured by the Leviathan”***
- Mash through being tortured
- [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>) at the end of the CS with Mission
  - As CS fades out on Carth, there is a window between when this CS ends and the next with Mission begins
  - During this window, mash QS and [Hard Buffer](<../Techniques/Save Buffering#hard-buffers>)
  - If your first QS is too early, you'll never switch to Mission and load as MC stuck in your cell.  This is a softlock, so load the Autosave.
  - If the cutscene initiates but you got a QS in, kill the game process in Task Manager or Alt-F4 and load the QS
  - If you didn’t get a QS, mash the cutscene  
- As Mission:
  - Turn left to the end of the hall and take door on left
  - Loot the Footlocker in this room for keycard
  - [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to Detention Cells

**Command Deck:**

*In the bridge section, you have to keep Carth and Bastila close to you in order to leave through the Bridge Storage door. Do your best to make sure they don't wander off, as that can and will lose you a lot of time. You can choose to QS/QL to reset their following AI; this sometimes helps.*

- *Force: Cast Knight Speed*
  - We do this to bash down doors more quickly
- QS/QL to fix party following AI
- Turn right and run/[Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) past the guard at the end of the hall as you turn left
  - He will almost always activate his shield, then throw a grenade, giving you enough time to get past
  - If he shoots instead, he'll aggro Carth/Bastila and you'll need to kill him
- Take the hall on the left and quickly bash open the armory door on the right
- Loot the Space Suit just inside on the left side
- Bash down the door on the far side of the room, then take the door on the left
- QS, then open the door across the hall 
- Run through, bash open the door, and go through
  - If MC gets stunned or debuffed, QL to avoid Duration Glitched negative status effects
  - If party members are debilitated, those will be removed when starting the spacewalk
- Open the Inner Airlock Door
- Spacewalk Skip:
  - Move so that the you're right next to the outer airlock door
  - Click to open the door and immediately QS once
  - QL and you should spawn with the airlock open and no Space Suit
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to the far airlock
- Activate Solo Mode
- As Bastila and Carth, [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) through the door on the right and stand in the near corners
  - This attempts to de-aggro them from the Sith Soldiers and place them near the exit
- Swap to MC and [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) up the ramp to the bridge door
- Saul Karath Skip:
  - Before attempting, you may want to make a hard save for safety; you can softlock here.
  - This trick is a save buffer, but the timing is quite precise
  - Open Bridge Door and spam QS twice, then load immediately
  - If the trick works, the bridge door will be open, the fight will not start, and Bastila and Carth will be in your party
  - If Bastila and Carth are not in your party, you've softlocked
  - If your last QS was too late, your game will crash when you load
  - You can also choose to disable V-Sync for this buffer; this makes it easier to load the final QS
- Once successful, hack bridge terminal: 1,2
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to the exit and enter the Command Deck
  - Bastila and Carth may be in combat or even dead, but they should still be close enough to the door to exit
  - If one of them died too far from the exit, you’ll have to kill the five soldiers
- *Heal: Medpac party as needed*
- *Force: Cast Knight Speed with MC*
- Kill the Sith Soldier nearby to the left
  - He will almost always aggro Carth/Bastila, so it's best to just eliminate him
- Swap to a party member and QS/QL to fix following AI
- Take left path and loop around outside back to elevator
  - If you are quick, it's possible to skip killing the two guards right outside the elevator
  - If any party member aggros on them, you'll likely have to kill them
  - Or you can use Solo Mode and [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to try to get everyone into the elevator
- Take the elevator to the Hangar: 3

### Hangar
- Activate Solo Mode
- [Save Teleport](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) to skip a Canderous CS outside the elevator

*Note: From here through Lehon, your [Save Teleports](<../Techniques/Save Teleporting>) may be too large and unwieldy to use effectively.  Casting Knight Speed will make it easier to control them but reduce the distance they cover, so use Speed sparingly and only in tight quarters.*

  - Jagi accosts Canderous
    - ***Starts "Jagi's Challenge"***
  - Immediately when the conversation ends, talk to Jagi again
    - This window to start the second conversation is very small; the best way is to pause and then talk to Jagi and unpause
    - The best way to do this is to get to Jagi's last line of dialog, then click and IMMEDIATELY pause the game
    - The convo is three 1s, then click five times to get to the last line: *"I shall be waiting for you there, Canderous."*
  - Jagi's 2nd convo: 2,2,2,2,2,2,2
    - You have to finish this conversation before Jagi walks out of range or the conversation will end early and the quest won't complete
    - ***Finishes “Jagi’s Challenge”***
