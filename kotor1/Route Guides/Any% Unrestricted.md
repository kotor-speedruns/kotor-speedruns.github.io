# Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic - Any% Unrestricted Guide

### v10.0: Male/Female Scoundrel Route

*Written by [Lane](https://www.speedrun.com/users/Lane) and [indykenobi](https://www.speedrun.com/users/indykenobi)*

This route defeats Malak on the Star Forge as fast as possible; Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends when the screen cuts to black at the start of the Malak Death cutscene. A load-removal tool and auto-splitter is available for LiveSplit thanks to [glasnonck](https://www.speedrun.com/users/glasnonck) and [XeroHR](https://www.speedrun.com/users/XeroHR) (results may vary for Windows 11 users); times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent. This guide will cover the character build and detailed route for the run.

Finally, if you have additional questions, you can check out the [KotOR Speedrunning Discord](http://discord.gg/Q2uPRVu). There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

## Unrestricted Ruleset

**REMEMBER to show yourself restarting the game at the beginning of each attempt.**

Any% Unrestricted is the fastest speedrun in KotOR I speedrunning, eclipsed only by KotOR II Any% Unrestricted.

All glitches are allowed in Unrestricted; however, all KotOR speedruns ban the following:
- Abusing the windowed nature of the game to teleport a character (including Super Save Teleports)
- Severe underclocking of one's monitor to increase Save Teleport distance
- Abusing the load removal to excessively pause the timer
- Loading saves created prior to the run
- Use of mods or other external tools to modify the software in any way 

## Guide Organization

Because of the power of the Unrestricted Ruleset, this run skips a huge amount of the game. Thus, things like alignment, credit/equipment routes, and even character build are either completely irrelevant or only briefly important. Thus, this guide is instead organized into two main sections that each cover all of the necessary details for the route.

*1. Route Overview* - A general description of the speedrun route, highlighting key skips and glitches used.  
*2. Detailed Route* - This section details the character build and route for the standard Scoundrel version of the speedrun, which uses a Skele FLU to obtain Sneak Attack IX and Improved Two-Weapon Fighting.

## Route Overview

### Save Setup

The updated route now uses a save system that requires *no pre-existing save files*.  If you click "Load Game" on the main menu, the game should give a pop-up saying you have no saved games.  This is superior to the old three-save method due to the advent of [Neo Hotshots](../Major%20Glitches/Hotshot#hss-hotshots), which are more efficient if your save is in either Slot 1 or the last save slot; in addition, saves are very slightly faster if you don't have to overwrite them.

### Route Outline

## Character Build

We begin as a Scoundrel; this guide as written can be completed as either a Male or Female character, with no time difference. However, Male MC has become the more common choice for [DLZ](../Major%20Glitches/Displaced%20Load%20Zone) visual cues. Scoundrel is picked for its access to Sneak Attack IX, which is abused to quickly kill the Sith Governor and Gadon Thek.

### Character Creation

**Initial Attributes:**
* Str - 8
* Dex - 16/18
* Con - 18/16
* Int - 8
* Wis - 10
* Cha - 10

The choice between 16 DEX/18 CON and vice-versa comes down to personal preference of runner; 18 DEX gives you a slightly better chance to hit Gadon and the Sith Governor, while 18 CON gives you slightly more survivability in the Sith Base on Taris and during the final fight with Malak.  If you do the Plot Armor glitch on Endar Spire, you should take 18 Dex, 14 Con, 14 Wis, and 10 Cha instead.

**Initial Skills:**
* Security - 4
* Awareness - 4 (Optional, can help spot mines)

**Initial Feat:** - Two-Weapon Fighting

### Leveling Plan

- *Level 2: [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>) to obtain:*
  - Improved Two-Weapon Fighting
  - Sneak Attack IX
- *Level 3: Auto-Level (Optional; gives slightly more Vitality for the Malak fight)*

**Character Build Notes:**

- *Attributes:* High DEX aids our chance to hit with ranged attacks for Taris. Dex and Con are used for survivability (if skipping Plot Armor). 10 Charisma is required for some Persuade checks on Kashyyyk. 10 Wisdom reduces the risk of failing will saving throws
- *Skills:* Security is the only skill necessary for the run, and is used for a skip on Endar Spire. Points in Awareness allow us to see some mines to avoid them, but it's not really necessary.
- *Feats:* IMproved Two-Weapon Fighting and Sneak Attack IX allow us to take out Gadon and the Sith Governor in short-order. We use Sniper Shot as our main combat feat because it's the default combat feat for Scoundrels.

## Endar Spire

*Before beginning, disable V-Sync in Advanced Graphics Options if you are using the Rubble DLZ on Endar Spire. This makes the DLZ more consistent.*

### Character Creation
- Male/Female Scoundrel - Custom Character  
- Dex to 16/18, Con to 18/16, Wis to 10, Cha to 10  
- Awareness to 4, Security to 4  
- Initial Feat: Two-Weapon Fighting

- Hit Play! (and be ready to [Hard Buffer](../Techniques/Save%20Buffering#hard-buffers)!)  


### Command Module

- [Hard Buffer](../Techniques/Save%20Buffering#hard-buffers) to skip the intro CS  
- [DLZ](../Major%20Glitches/Displaced%20Load%20Zone#endar-spire-dlz) into the Starboard Section through one of the following two methods:
  - ***Method One: Rubble DLZ***
    - *This strat is potentially 20 seconds faster, but the DLZ is marginally harder.  This is the recommended method.*
    - Skip the footlocker and talking to Trask
    - [Open Buffer](../Techniques/Save%20Buffering#open-buffers) past Trask to use Security during Trask's first conversation
    - DLZ by walking into the rubble near the second Sith soldier in the right spot
  - ***Method Two: Doorframe DLZ***
    - *This strat is much easier, but significantly slower than a good Rubble DLZ.  Recommended only for brand-new runners.*
    - Loot footlocker
    - *Equip MC: Short Sword*
    - Open door and Talk to Trask twice
    - *Equip Trask: Blaster Pistol Offhand*
    - [Open Buffer](../Techniques/Save%20Buffering#open-buffers) to use Security during the Carth CS
    - Kill first two Sith with Trask's Power Blast and open next door
    - DLZ by walking into the right side of the door frame in the right spot

### Starboard Section

- ***Optional Strat: Plot Armor***  
  - *This strat grants a minimum HP of 1 (called "Plot Armor" for short) for the rest of the run, but requires redoing the Spire DLZ and costs a minimum of 10 seconds (but likely more). The run can be done without it, but this strat provides a little safety if desired.*
  - *To obtain Plot Armor:*
    - Activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the load screen after the prior [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>)
    - After Carth's convo starts, [access the Options Menu](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch#accessing-menus>) to **Hard Save in New Slot (Slot 1)**
    - Immediately load the Slot 1 Hard Save and activate [AMG](<../Major Glitches/Anywhere Menu Glitch>) on the load
      - This keeps your QS in the Command Module
    - Perform the [QS Hotshot](<../Major Glitches/Hotshot#quick-save-hotshots>) to return to the Command Module
    - [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#endar-spire-dlz>) into the Starboard Section again, using whatever method you used before     
  - *If you choose not to use the above strat:*
    - Activate [AMG](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch) on the load screen for the Starboard Section
    - After Carth's convo starts, [begin moving to the next room](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch#moving-during-cutscenes) while Carth narrates  
    - QS next to the footlocker to end the CS
- Loot footlocker in Terminal Room  
- Hack terminal console: 2,3  
- Carth accosts you  
- Take escape pod to Taris  
- Quickly [Free-Look AMG](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch#free-look-amgs) to skip the vision CS
  - Activate [AMG](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch) on the load screen
  - Unpause, cancel, and hit the free-look hotkey twice
  - Hold down QS while this cutscene plays, which skips forward through the animation (This saves between 4-5 seconds)

  - Deactivate V-Sync for this DLZ
- Return to Hideout and immediately Transit Back
  - During this, *Party: Add Carth*
  - This sets our transit point to return to later
- Activate Solo Mode
- Use a [Conversation Queue](<../Techniques/Conversation Queue>) to skip the Gang War CS:
  - Run Carth along the right wall until just before it ends (where the CS triggers)
  - Swap to MC and talk to Carth, then immediately swap to Carth and turn right to the end of the hall
  - The [Conversation Queue](<../Techniques/Conversation Queue>) also ensures that MC follows Carth to the Vulkar Base
- ***Optional:*** Kill the two guards outside the Vulkar Base
  - This wastes time but makes the following trick slightly easier to perform
- [Door Clip](<../Major Glitches/Door Clipping#partial-door-clips>) and [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#vulkar-base-dlz>) to enter Vulkar Base:
  - As Carth, run into right corner of Vulkar Base door
  - While running forward, swap to MC; Carth should bump out from the corner
  - As MC, run into right corner and while running, QS/QL
  - If the trick worked, you'll [DLZ](<../Major Glitches/Displaced Load Zone#vulkar-base-dlz>) into the Vulkar Base after the QL

- Kill Gadon:
  - As MC, Snipe Shot for Sneak Attack  
  - As Carth, Power Blast  
  - Note that Kaeira doesn't have to die  
- As soon as Gadon is dead, Hotshot back to Vulkar Base in one of two ways:

  - Activate [AMG](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch) during the load into Davik's Estate  
  - Go through the conversation pressing 1 and left-click (don't use NumPad Enter!)  
  - After the screen fades to black, cancel the quit dialog and QS/QL to skip the CS
- ***Optional:** Equip MC: Vibrosword*
  - This allows you to move more easily during the Upper Shadowlands cutscenes
- Board the Ebon Hawk, then use a [Map CS Skip](../Techniques/Map%20Cutscene%20Skips) to Return to Ebon Hawk

## Dantooine

### Jedi Enclave

  - Deactivate V-Sync for this and the other Dantooine DLZs
  - Activate [AMG](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch) on the load screen when this DLZ fires  
  - *Note: There is a a decent amount of slack for how quickly you need to get this DLZ, as you will save an identical amount of time as long as you get the DLZ before NPC Bastila arrives at the council.*

### Courtyard

    - Enter the Malak convo with Bastila on the right edge of the walkway
    - After the convo (which is 2), immediately throw a Thermal Detonator with Bastila, then swap to MC and run towards the right
    - As Bastila's first Detonator explodes, throw a Thermal Detonator with MC
    - Swap between Bastila and MC; on each swap, cancel combat, then queue a Thermal Detonator
      - If you just queue multiple thermals, MC/Bastila will not update their aim as Malak is knocked back, causing later thermals to miss
      - Try to get a good rythym going to stun-lock Malak while knocking him back toward the Jedi Popsicle where his CS will be
    - If you don't have Plot Armor the MC can generally only take two or three hits (less if you get hit with a thermal)
  - Anytime during the first phase, activate [AMG](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch) via a QS
  - When Malak goes non-hostile, he will run to his CS and start it
  - Click twice to reach the first dialog option, then press Enter to simultaneously cancel the pop-up dialog and select the first conversation option
  - Immediately QS/QL to skip the CS
- Slightly more than 1 second after loading, the mouse will disappear and the final death CS will start, ending the run
  - If you load in to a non-hostile Malak and no CS, then you mistimed the QS/QL during the prior conversation
  - ***Backup Strat: [Wired Targeting](../Techniques/Wired%20Targeting)***
    - This strat works best if you made a safety save before Malak
      - If you don't have a safety save, you're probably stuck with the Autosave on Deck 1 and a dead run
    - From the load in to a non-hostile Malak and no CS, swap to Bastila, stand next to Malak, and QS
    - Load your safety save and begin the Malak fight again as Bastila
    - When Malak goes hostile, spam default action (as Bastila) while you QL
    - After the load, when Bastila hits the non-hostile Malak, the final CS should start and the run will end

*Congratulations! Malak has been defeated once and for all, and you are now the Lord of the Sith (and you aren't even a Jedi!)*
